is the love of wealth weaker than the love of women? This HOM-
Ῑέἶ is'manifest from many reasons. In the first place, lust V.

 

· »ἧς springs from the necessity os nature, and what arises from this

necessity must be difficult to restrain, since it is implanted

¹ in our nature. Secondly‚ because the ancients had no re-

J„ gard for wealth, but forr women they had great regard, in re-
spect of their chastity. And no one blamed him who coha-

bited with his wife according to law, even to old age, but all

ζ blamed him who boarded money. And many of the Heathen
3ss philosophers despised money, but none of them were indif-

¹ *serent to women, so that this passion is more imperIOus than
the other. But since we are addressing the Church, let us
not take our examples from the HeathenS, but from the

³ ScriptureS. This then the blessed Paul places almost in the

z rank of a¹ command. Havinq food and raiment, let us be lTim.6‚

And the blessed Paul sayS, Μανία-96 is honour able in all, Heb 13,

not, they that will be covetouS‚ but, they that will be rich.
And that you may learn from the common notions the true

state of this matter, it must be set before you generally. If a
