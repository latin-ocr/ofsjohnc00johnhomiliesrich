You see how again he commands Timothy not even to
meet them. Avoidinq oppositione. There are therefore oppo—
sitions to which we ought not to vouchsafe an answer, be-
cause they turn men from faith, and do not suffer one to be
firmly established or fixed in it. Let us not then pursue this
science, but adhere to saith, that unshaken rock. For neither
floods nor winds assailin g will be able to harm US, since we stand
on the rock immoveable. Thus even in this life, if we choose
Him, Who is truly the foundation, we stand, and no harm
assails US. v For what can hurt him who hath chosen the
ric-heS, the honour, the glory, the pleasure of the life to come?
They are all firm, in them there is no variableness3 all things
here are subject to reverse, and are for ever changing. For

robbed of his virtue. He who rules himself, cannot become
a common man and a subject.

And that this rule is superior to any other, will appear upon
examination. For of what advantage, tell me, is it to reign
over nations of our fellow men, and to be the slaves of our
1 own passions? or what are we the worse for having no one
under our rule, if we are superior to the tyranny of the pas-
sions? That indeed is F reedom, that is Rule, that is Royalty
and Sovereignty. The contrary is slavery, though a man be
invested with countless diadems. For when a multitude of
masters sway him from within, the love of money, the love of
pleasure, and anger, and other passionS, what avails his dia-

dem? The tyranny of those passions is more severe, when
