Ἴ engaged in sin is unarmed, as he who practises righteous-
, 11688 18 armed. We do not fortify ourselves with almsgiving.
We do not prepare for ourselves lamps that are burning, we
do not fence ourselves in spiritual armour. We do not learn
the way that leads thither. We are not sober and watchful,
and therefore we can seize no spoil.

If a man wishes to make an attempt on a kingdom, does
he not set death before him in a thousand shapes? Is he
not armed at all points, does he not practise the art of war,
does he not do every thing with this view, and so rush on
to the attack? But we do not act 111118. We wish to take
the spoil while we are sleeping‚ and therefore we come off
with empty hands. Dost thou not 866 plundererS, how they

disturb, or to stay thy course.

Hast thou seized? Yet a little exertion is needed after
the seizure‚ that what thou hast seized may not be taken
from thee. If we run on, if we look to none of those things
that are set before our eyeS, if we consider nothing but how
we may escape from those who would hinder us, we shall be
able to retain with all security what we have seized. Hast
thou seized on chastity? Tarry not3 fiee beyond the reach
of the devil. lf he sees that he cannot overtake thee, he
will cease to pursue 3 as we, when we can no longer see
those who have robbed us, despair of the pursuit, and do not
pursue, nor call on others to stop thief, but suffer them to
escape. So do thou run vigorously at the beginning, and
when thou art beyond the reach of the devil, he will not
afterwards attack thee, but thou wilt be in safety‚ securely
enjoying those unspeakable blessingS, which God grant that
