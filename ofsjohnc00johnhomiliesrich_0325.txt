see how many varieties of uncleanness there are. The
ψ woman in childbed is unclean. Yet God made child-birth,
and the seed of copulation. Why then is the woman un-
clean, unless something further was intimated? And what
was this? He intended to produce piety in the soul, and to
deter it from fornication. For if she is unclean who has

attends a funeral is unclean, much more he who has mixed

in war and slaughter. And many kinds of uncleanness would

be found, if it were necessary to recount them all. But

the very house where the ill-gotten treasure is laid up. But
the Jews consider this as nothing. And yet Moses carried
off the bones of J oseph. Samson drank from the jawbone
of an aSS, and ate honey from the lion, and Elijah was
nourished by ravens‚ and by a widow woman. And tell
me, if wewere to be precise about these things, what can be
more unclean than our bookS‚ which are made of the skins of

 

animals? The fornicator, then, is not the only one that is
unclean, but others more than he, as the adulterer. But both
the one and the other are unclean, not on account of the
intercourse, (for according to that reasoning a man cohabit-

wickedness of the act, and the injury done to his neighbour
