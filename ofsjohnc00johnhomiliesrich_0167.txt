1 Tm. v. 21, 22, 23.

I charqe thee before G'ool and the Lord Jesus Christ and
’ the elect Ληρεῖς, that thou observe these thinqs without
preferrinq one before another, doiny nothiny by parti-
ality. Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither hepartalcer
(ff other men’s sins: keep thyself pure. Drinlc no lonyer
water, but use a little wine for thy stomaeh's sake ond
thine often infirmitieS.

HAVING spoken of Bishops and DeaconS, of men, and
women, of widows and elders, and of all otherS‚ and having
shewn how great was the authority of a Bishop, now he was
speaking of judgment, he has added, I charye thee before
God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect Ληρεῖς, that
thou obsera-e these thinys without preferriny one before
another, doing] nothiny by partiality. Thus searfully he
charges him. For though Timothy was his beloved son, he
did not therefore stand in awe of him. For as he was not
ashamed to say of himself, Lest by any means when I hamlocne,
preat-hed to othere, Ι myself should be a cast-awoy; much 2⁷·
less would he be afraid or ashamed in the case of Timothy.

He called the Father and the Son to witness. But wherefore

the elect Angels? From great moderatiori, as Moses said, Deut.4
Ι eall heaven ancl earth to ‘udtness ,· and again, Hem„ ye’ff: h ›

calls the Father and the Son to witness what he has said,
