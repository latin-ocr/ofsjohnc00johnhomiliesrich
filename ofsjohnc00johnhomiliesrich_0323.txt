with that they were cleansed. This therefore was a doctrine

for children. In the composition of wine, does not dung form
ἲ 3 part? For as the vine draws moisture from the earth, so
, does it from the dung that is thrown upon it. In short,
if we wish to be very nice, every thing is unclean, otherwise
if we please not to be nice, nothing is unclean. Yet all

unclean, except sin only. For that reaches to the soul, and
defiles it. Other uncleanness is human prejudice.

But unto them that are defiled and unbelievz'ny is nothing]
pure ; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.

For how can there be any thing unclean among the pure?
But he that has a weak soul makes every thing unclean, and
i if there be set abroad a scrupulous inquiry into what is clean
or unclean, he will touch nothing. For even these things are

notions3 (for their mind and conscience, he sayS, is defiled,)
but all are impure. Yet Paul says not so; he turns the whole
matter upon themselves. For nothing is unclean, he says, but

But be ,not thou silent on that account. Do thy part,
although they may not receive thee. Advise and counsel
them, though they may not be persuaded. Here he censures
them more severely. F or they who are mad imagine that
nothing stands still, yet this arises not from the objects that
are seen, but from the eyes that see. Because they are un-
steady and giddy, they think that the earth turns round with
them, which yet turns not, but stands firm. The derange-
