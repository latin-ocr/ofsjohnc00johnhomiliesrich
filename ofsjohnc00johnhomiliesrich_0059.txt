with respect to himself appears rich, but upon a comparison
with the treasures of kings is very poor and the chief of the
poor3 so it is in this case. Compared with AngeIS, even
righteous men are sinners3 and if Paul, who wrought the
righteousness that is in the law, was the chief of sinners,
what other man can be called righteous? For he says not
this to condemn his own life as impure, let not this be imagined3
but comparing his own legal righteousness with the righte-
ousness of God, 116 shews it to be nothing worth, and not

See how he further humbles and depreciates himself, by
naming a fresh and less creditable reason. For that he ob-
tained mercy on account of his ignorance, does not so much
imply that he who obtained mercy was a sinner, or under
deep condemnation3 but to say that he obtained mercy in
order that no sinner hereafter might despair of finding mercy,
but that each might feel sure of obtaining the like favour,
this is an excess of humiliation, such that even in calling
himself the chief of sinnerS, a blasphemer (md a persecutor,
and (me not meet to be called cm Apostle, he had said
nothing like it. This will appear by an example. Suppose

more s0, and some 1688, but all deserving of condemnation 3
and let one among that multitude be more deserving of punish-
ment than all the rest, and guilty of every kind of wickedness.
