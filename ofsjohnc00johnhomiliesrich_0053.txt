Love to G'od throuqlz Christ. Apathy qs lllen. 27

„ Let us then love God through Christ. What means Hom.
· ‘through Christ’? That it is He, and not the Law, who 111.
has enabled us to do this. Observe what blessings we Mssfflb
owe to Christ, and what to the Law. And he says not
merely that grace has abounded, but abozmded eoeceedinyly,
¹ in bringing at once to the adoption those who deserved
infinite punishment.

And observe again that ine is used for throuyhe. For not
only saith is necessary, but love. Since there are many still
who believe that Christ is God, who yet love Him not, nor
act like those who love Him. For how is it when they
prefer every thing to Him, money, nativity, fate, augury,
divinationS, omens? When we live in defiance of Him,
pray, where is our love? Has any one a warm and affection-
ate friend? Let him love Christ but equally. So, if no more,
let him lo've Him who gave His Son for us His enemieS, who
had no merits of our own. Merits did I say? who had com-
ὲ «ωἱῐιθᾶ numberless sinS, who had dared Him beyond all
daring, and without cause ! yet He, after numberless instances
of goodness and care, did not even then cast us off. At the
very time when we did Him the greatest. wrong, then did
He give His Son for us. And still we, after so great benefitS,
after being made His friendS, and counted worthy through
Him of all blessingS, have not loved Him as our friend‘!
What hope then can be ours? You shudder perhaps at the
word, but Ι would that you shuddered at the fact! What?
Ἴ How shall it appear that we do not love God even as our
friends, you say? I will endeavour to shew you—and would
that my words were groundless, and to no purpose ! but I am
afraid they are borne out by facts. For consider: friends,
that are -truly fri-ends, will often suffer loss for those they
love. But for Christ, no one will suffer loss, or even be
content with his present state. For a friend we can readily
submit to insultS, and undertake quarrels3 but for Christ, no
one can endure enmity: and the saying is, ‘⁶ Be loved for
nothing—but be not hated for nothing.”
