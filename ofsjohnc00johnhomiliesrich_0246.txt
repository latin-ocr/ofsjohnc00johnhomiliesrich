2 Tm. Ver. 25. In meekness instructiuy those that oppose them·

‘²²25‘ 2& selves.

For he that teaches must be especially careful to do iti}
with meekness. For a soul that wishes to leam cannot gain ’ξ
any useful instruction from harshness and contention. For
when it would apply, being thus thrown into perplexity, it ’χ
will learn nothing. He who would gain any useful know·

In this temper, you see, we ought to address ourselves to
those who are willing to learn, and never cease from convers-
ing with them till we have come to the demonstration b.

vIt is truly said, Wlw are taken eaptivec, for meanwhile
they fioat in error. Observe here how he teaches to be hum-
ble-minded. He has not said, if peradventure you should be
able, but, ffperadventure Gor] should qrant them a recovery5
if any thing be done, therefore, all is of the Lord. Thou
plantest‚ thou waterest, but He soweth and maketh it produce
fruit. Let us not therefore be so affected, as if we ourselves
wrought the persuasion, even if we should persuade any one.
