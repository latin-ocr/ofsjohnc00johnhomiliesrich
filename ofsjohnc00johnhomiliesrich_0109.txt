What then can we do but weep? For hardly is a small

portion of the world in the way of salvation, and they who
are perishing hear it, and rejoice that they are not destined to
,χ suffer alone, but in company with numbers. But what cause
²⁵25 is this for joy? That very 1 oy will subject them to punish-
(ζῇ ment. For do not think· that it is there as here, that to have
l'gj* companions in suffering affords consolation. And whence is
this manifest? I will make it clear. Suppose that a man were
commanded to be burnt, and that he saw his own son burning
with him, and that the smell of his scorched flesh rose to his
nostrils3 would it not be of itself death to him? No doubt.
And I will tell you how it is. If those who are not suffering,
sfj yet seeing those things are benumbed and faint with terror,
ᾖ much more will they be so affected, who are themselves
sufferers. Wonder not at this. Hear a certain wise one
saying, Art thou become wealc as we? art thou become like
ἶ anto us? For human nature is disposed to sympathy, and
the affections of others move us to pity. Will then a father
seeing his son in the same condemnation, or a husband his
Ξῖ· wife, or a man his fellow man, receive consolation, and not
rather an aggravation of his sufferings? Are not we in such
case the more overcome? But there, you say, there are no
⁸* such feelings. I know there are not, but there are others
much more wretched. For there will be wailing inconso-
lable, all witnessing each other's torments. Do they who
› are famishing derive comfort in their distress from the parti-
cipation of others? It is no consolation surely to see a son,
a father, a wife, or grandchildren, suffering the same punish-
ment. If one sees friends in such case, is it any comfort?
⁶ None! None! It rather adds to the intensity of our own
sufferings! BesideS, there are evile, which by reason of their
severity cannot be mitigated by being common. If two men

were together thrown into the fire, would they comfort one

another? Tell me3 if we have ever been attacked by a

violent sever, have we not found that all consolation has

failed us? for there are calamities, so overwhelming as to

leave no room for comfort in the soul. When a wife has lost
