306 Adoral disadvantayes of the state qf'slavery.

honour of a free condition, and many other advantages3 it is
difficult to escape intimacies with the wicked, what can we
expect from those who are destitute of all these, and are
mixed up with the wicked, and associate fearlessly with
whomsoever they will, no one troubling herself about their
friendships? What sort of persons do we suppose they will
be? On this account it is difficult for any servant to be
good, especially when they have not the benefit of instruction
either from those without or from ourselves. They do not
converse with free men of orderly conduct, who have a great
regard for their reputation. For all these reasons it is a
difficult and surprising thing that there should ever be a

When therefore it is seen that the power of religion, impos-
ing a restraint upon a class naturally so sels-willed, has 'ren-

he restores to a healthy and sane state one who was de-
spaired of, whom nothing benefited, who was unable to com-

observe what he most requires of them3 the qualities which
contribute most to their masters’ ease.

Not answerinq aqam, not purloininy; that is, to shew all
good will in matters intrusted to them, to be particularly
faithful in their masters' concernS‚ and obedient to their com-
mands.

Do not therefore think that I enlarge upon this subject ἢ
without a purpose. For the rest of my discourse will be ad-
dressed to servants. Look not to this, my good friend, that
thou servest a man, but that thy service is to God, that thou ‚
