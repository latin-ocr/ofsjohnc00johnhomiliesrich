’,611 for 118. For therefore it is that He has revealed them HOM-
s all, and made them known to 118, and not merely told us HI'
{of them, but given us assurance of them by what He 1168
done. Though He was worthy of credit upon His word
only, that no one may think it is said hyperbolically, or in

the way of threatening merely, we have further assui-auce by

His works. How? By the punishments which He has in-
flicted both publicly and privately. And that thou mayest
learn by the very exampleS, at one time he punished Pharaoh,

at another time He brought a flood of water upon the earth,

and that utter destruction, and again at another time a flood

of fire: and even now we see in many instances the wicked
suffering ven geance,and punishmentS, which things are figures

of Hell.

For lest we should slumber and be slothful‚ and forget His (3)
word, He awakens our minds by deeds3 shewing 118, even
here, courts of justice, judgment seatS, and trials. Is there
then among men so great a regard for justice, and doth God,
whose ordinance even these things are, make no account of
it? Is this credible? In a house, in a market-place, there is
6, court of justice. The master daily sits in judgment upon
1118 slaveS, calls them to account for their offences, punishes
some and pardons others. In the country, the husbandman
and his wife are daily at law. In a ship, the master is
judge, and in a camp the general over his soldierS, and every
where one may see judicial proceedings. In trades, the
master judges the learner. In short all, publicly and pri-
vately, are judges to one another. In nothing is the con-
sideration of justice overlooked, and all in every place give
account of their actions, And is the inquisition for justice
here thus *spread through 611168, through 11011868, and among
individuals3 and is there no regard for what is justice there,
where the riyht hand ‘ff God is full of riylzteousneSS, and p„ 48
His riyhteousness is as the mountains of God. P {9- 6
