196 St. Paul's trials cm encourayement to other&

1 T1M· world, is a prisoner, and afflicted, yet is not impatient, nor 1
2'1-7'discontented upon the desertion of his friends 3 he, if ever
exposed to thc same sufferings himself, would not consider
that it proceeded from human weakneSS, nor from the circum·
stance of his being a disciple, and inferior to Paul, since his
teacher too suffered the like, but that all this happened from ’
the natural course of things. For Paul himself did this ²¹, and
related what had befallen him, that he might strengthen
Timothy, and renew his courage. Andhe shews that it was
for this reason he mentioned his trials and afflictions, in that he
has added, Thou therefore, my son, be stronq in tlte yrace

that is in Christ Jews, What sayest thou? Thou hast
shaken us with terrOrS, thou hast told us that thou art in ¹

Eph. 6, For elsewhere he says, We wrestle not aqaz‘nst flesh, and

Be sober therefore, he meanS, and watch, have the grace of
the Lord cooperating with thee, and aiding thee in thy
contest, contribute thy own part with much alacrity and
resolution. And the thinys that thou least heard of me amony
many milne-sse& the same commit thou to faithful men, to
faithful men, not to questioners, nor to reasoners, to faithful.
How faithful? Such as betray not the Gospel they should
