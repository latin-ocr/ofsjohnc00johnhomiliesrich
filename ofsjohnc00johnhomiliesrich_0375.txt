ἱ By this also he has quenehed his anger, by delivering him H'

ἲ» up. For masters are then most enraged, when they are

· ἵ intreated for the absent, so that by this very aet he mollified

= him the more.

¹ Ver. 12„ Thou therefore receive him, that is mine own

’ And again he has not given the bare name, but uses with

,ι it a word that might move him, which is more affectionate

Ἴ than son. He has said, son, he has said, I have beqotten

Ἴ him d, so that it was probable⁶ he would love him much,

, because he begot him in his trials. For it is manifest that

:we are most inflamed with affection for those children, who

have been born to us in dangers which we have escaped, as

’ when the Scripture saith, ⁶ Woe, Barochabelfl' and again

when Rachel names Benjamin, the son ofmy sorrow. gen-35,

‘e- Thou therefore, he says, receive him, that is mine own “
howel& He shews the greatness of his affection. He has

not' said, Take him back ¹, He has not said, Be not angryzLoz-raeagoe,

but receive him ; that is, he is worthy not only of pardon, ssfff'n*

but of honour. Why? Because he is become the son of

η Paul.

Ver. 13. Whom I would have retained with me, that in

’ thy stead he miyht have mini-§iered mtto me in the bonds of
the Gospel.

y Dost thou see aster how much previous preparation, he

has at length brought him honourably before his master, and

§bbserve with how much wisdom he has done this. See for

&how much he makes him answerable, and how much he

ψ honours the other. Thou hast found, he says, a way by
which thou mayest through him repay thy service to me.
Here he shews that he has considered his advantage more
than that of his slave, and that he respects him exceedingly.

Ver. 14. But without thy mind, he sayS‚ would I do

nothin9; that thy benefit should not be, as it were, of

Ι necessity, but willinyly.
