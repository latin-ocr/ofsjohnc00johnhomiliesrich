was but one man, yet how many did he draw after him? If 2
we were all such as he, how many worlds might we not have
drawn to us? Behold, Christians are more numerous than
Heathens. And in other 3118, 0116 111311 6311 163611 3 hundred ³

and many more than the 163111618, 110 0116 18 brought over.
For those who are taught, look to the virtue of their teachers :1
and when they see us manifesting the same desireS‚ pursuing
the same objectS‚ power and honour, how can they admire
Christianity? They see our lives open to reproach, our souls
worldly. We admire wealth equally with them, and even
more. We have the same horror of death, the same dread of
poverty, the same impatience of disease, we are equally fond
of glory and of rule. We harass ourselves to death from our
love of money, and serve the time. How then can they believe?
From miracles? But these are no longer wrought. From our
conversation? It has become corrupt. From charity? Not
a trace of it is any where to be seen. Therefore we shall
have to give an account not only of our own sins, but of the-
injury done by them to 0111618.

amongst 118, but ‘ how: says the Greek, ‘ shall I believe it?
for Ι do not see any thing like it in your conduct. If
this is to be said, we too have had our philosophers‚ men ad-
mirable for their lives.’ ‘ But shew me another Paul, or a
John: you cannot.' Would he not then laugh at us for
reasoning in this manner? Would he not continue to sit
still in ignorance, seeing that the wisdom we profess is in
wordS, not in works? For now for a single halfpenny ye are
ready to slay or be slain! For a handful of earth thou raisest
lawsuit after lawsuit! For the death of a child thou turnest
all upside down! I omit other things that might make us
weep3 your 3113111168, your 01116118, your superstitious observ-
311668, your casting of nativities, your signs, your amuletS,
your divinations, your incantationS‚ your magio arts. These
