s “ But how does he fall into a sna-re? By falling often into the
J j same sinS, as those who are without. For if he be such a
[ζ τ· character, the evil one soon lays another snare for him, and they
soon effect his destruction. But if he should have a good
J ⁷ report from his enemieS‚ much more will he have it from his
χ : friends. For that it is not likely that he, whose life is blame-
ᾖ leSS, should be ill -reported of, we may infer from the words
⁴7? of Christ; Let your liylzt 80 chine before men, that they mayl Matt. 5,
see your 90οά work-5, and ylorify your Fatlzer which is inl
Heaven. But what if one be falsely accused, and from pecu-
liar circumstances be slandered? Well, this is a possible
l} case3 but even such an one ought not to be promoted. For
ὲ the result 1s much to be feared. Therefore it is said he should
ς have a 90οά 'erort for your good works ale to shine. As there-
fore no one will say that the sun is dark, not even the blind,
⁴⁸ (for he will be ashamed to oppose the opinion of all ,) so him

though, on account of his doctrineS, the Heathen will often
ζ’ slander him, yet they will not attack his v irtuous life, but will

join with others 111 admiring and revering it.

ἐζ need of words, if we so shone forth in our liveS, there were no
need of TeacherS, did we but exhibit works. There would be
no Heathen, if we were such Christians as we ought to be. If

we kept th'e commandments of Christ, if we suffered injury,

if we allowed advantage to be taken of us, if being reviled we
ι blessed, if being ill-treated we did good3 if this were the 1 Cor.4,
³= general practice among US, no one would be so brutal as not¹2·
