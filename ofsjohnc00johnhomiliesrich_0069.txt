Offendiny Christiane why delivered to Satan. 48

ἶ saith without a good life is unavailing‚ much more is the Hom.
s· converse true. If God despises His own for our sakes, much ‘

 

’ more ought we to despise our own for His sake ¹¹. For so it

is, where any one falls away from the saith, he has no steadi-
ness, he swims this way and that, till at last he is lost in the
deep.

’ leom I leave delivered to Satan, that they may leam not
to blaspheme! Thus it is blasphemy to search into divine
things by our own reasoningS. For what have human rea-
sonings in common with them? But how does Satan instruct
them not to blaspheme? can he instruct others, who has not
yet taught himself, but is a blasphemer still? It is not that
‘ he should instruct,' but that they should be instruc-ted. It
is not he that does it, though such is the result. As elsewhere
he says in the case of the fornicator: To deliver such cm one
to Satan'for the destruction of tloeeflesle. Not that he may] Cor.5,

y save the body, but that the spirit may be saved. Therefore 5.
’ it is spoken impersonally. How then is this effected? As

executionem, though themselves laden with numberless crimeS,
are made the correctors of others3 so it is here with the evil
spirit.. But why didst thou not punish them thyself, as thou
didst that Bar—Jesus, and as Peter did Ananias, instead of
delivering them to Satan? It was not that they might be
punished, but that they might be instructed. For that he
had the power appears from other passages, leat will ye? 1 Cor.
shall I come unte you with a rod 5? And again, Lest I 3³]szssng-
use sharpneSS, according} to tlte power which tlze Lord laath 13, 1⁰·
yiven me to edification, {md not to destruction. Why did he
then call upon Satan to punish them? That the disgrace
might be greater, as the severity and the punishment was
more striking. Or rather, they themselves chastised those who
did not yet believe, but those who turned aside, they delivered
to Satan. Why then did Peter punish Ananias? Because whilst
he was tempting the Holy Ghost, he was still an unbeliever.
That the unbelieving therefore might learn that they could not

escape, they themselves inflicted punishment upon them3

which is most towards Him of all we neglect that duty to Him. See St.
