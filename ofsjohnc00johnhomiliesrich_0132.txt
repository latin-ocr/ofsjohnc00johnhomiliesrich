Observe how often he gives him counsel concerning the
same things, thus shewing that a teacher ought above all
things to be attentive to these points,

Ver. 16. Take lteed, he sayS, unto thy-sels, and unto the

and teach others aISO.

For in so doiny thou skalt both save thyself and them that

It is well said, leou shall save thyself. For he that is
nourislzed up in the words of sound doctrine, first receives
the benefit of it himself. From admonishing others, he is
touched with compunction himself. For these things are not
said to Timothy only, but to all. And if such advice is

reaped from the ScriptureS. But we are indolent, and we
hear with carelessness and indifference. What punishment
do we not deserve ἔ

Thus he would have him appear great and admirable in

him, for he wished that his profitiny should appear not only
in his life, but in the word of doctrine.
