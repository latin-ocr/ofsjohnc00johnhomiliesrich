ΙιἪέἔ. pending ovgr us, guid hthe ‘givgng account, and jitiltllgments13 we
' ” ave gone eyon s es m evounng one auo er, we ave
thrown wolves and lions into the shade in ravaging one
another's possessions3 if He did not call us to account, and
we were persuaded of this, with how great tumult and con-
fusion would life be filled? What would be the sabled
labyrinth after this, compared with the perplexities of the
world? Would you not see numberless indecencies and
disorders? For who then would have respected his father
any more? or who would have spared his mother? Who
would have left unattempted any pleasure, any wickedness?
And that the matter is SO, I will endeavour to shew you
from one house only. How? You who raise these questions
and who have servants ; if I could make it manifest to these,
'’fn“ that if they should destroy the family of their masters ¹, if
’.ω’ they should insult their persons, if they should plunder every
thing, if they should turn things upside down, if they should
treat them as enemieS, they would not threaten them, nor

it is the extreme of cruelty, not only because the wife and
children are betrayed by this unseasonable kindneSS, but
because the slaves themselves are destroyed before them.

destroy both themselves and others beside? Seest thou that to
call men to account is a proof of great goodness? But why ’
do I speak of slaveS, who more readily sall into these sins?
But let a man have sonS, and let him permit them to do
every thing they will, and let him not punish them3 will they
not be worse than any thing? tell me. In the case of men
then, it is a mark of goodness to punish, and of cruelty not
to punish, and is it not so in the case of God? So that
because He is good, therefore He has prepared a hell.

And do you wish that Ι should speak of another instance
of God’s goodness? It is not only this, but that He does not
suffer the good to become bad. For if they were destined to
meet with the same thingS, they would all be bad. But now
this also does not a little console the good. For hear the
