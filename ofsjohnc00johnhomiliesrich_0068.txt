1 Cor.9,

42 A bad Conscience leads to Unbelicf.

slcouldest war in them, he says. For as in an army all do
not serve in the same capacity, but in their different stations ;
so also in the Church one has the office of a Teacher, another
that of a disciple, another that of a private man. But thou
art in this. And, because this is not sufficient, he adds,

Ver. 19. Holdinysaz'tlz, and a qood conscience.

For he that would be a Teacher must first teach himself.
For as he who has not first been a good soldier, will never
be a general, so it is with the Teacher3 wherefore he says
elsewhere, Lcst when I have prcaclecd to otkch, Ι mysch‘*
should be a cast-away. Holdiny saith, he says, and a qood
conscience, that so thou mayest preside over others. When
we hear this, let us not disdain the exhortations of our
superiors, though we be Teachers. For if Timothy, to whom
all of us together are not worthy to be compared, receives
commands and is instructed, and that being himself in the
Teacher’s office, much more should we. Which som-c

And this follows naturally. For when the life is corrupt,
it engenders a doctrine congenial to it, and :from this cir-

and to turn aside into Heathenism. For that they may not
be tormented with the fear of futurity, they endeavour to
persuade their souls, that what we preach is false. And some
turn aside from the 131111, who see-k out every thing by rea-
soning3 for reasoning produces shipwreck, while saith is as 3
safe ship.

They then who turn aside from the faith must suffer ship»
wreck3 and this he shews by an example.

And from 1113111 113 would instruct us. You see how even
from those times there have been seducing TeacherS, curious
inquirerS, and men holding off from the saith, and searching
oute by their own reasonings. As the shipwrecked man is
naked and destitute of all things, so is he that falls away
from the saith without resource, he knows not where to stand
or where to stay himself, nor has he the advantage of a good
life 50 35 10 gain any thing from that quarter. For when the
head is disordered, what avails the rest of the body? and if
