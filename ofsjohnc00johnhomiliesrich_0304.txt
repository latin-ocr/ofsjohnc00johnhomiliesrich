Tuus after his elevation to rule. For he is then more strongly
--1' 4. assailed by vainglory‚ and the love of wealth, and sels-will,
when office gives him the power3 and by offenceS,insultS,and
reproacheS‚ and numberless other evils, If therefore any one
be irreligiOUS, he will become more so when raised to office3
and he who appoints such a ruler will be answerable for all
the offences committed by him, and for the whole people.
Matt. But if it is said os him who gives offence to one soul, It were
¹8⁹ 6. better for him that a millstone were kanyed about lais neck,
and that lze were drowned in the depth Qf' the sea ; what
will he have to suffer who offends so many souls‚ whole cities
and populationS‚ and multitudes of families⁶, men, women,
children, citizenS, and husbandmen, the inhabitants of the city
itself, and of all places subject to it ? To say thrice as much

thou hast only one soul for which to give an account, and for η ,
it alone wilt thou be auswerable. But when thou art raised
to this office, consider for how many persons thou art ob· s
Heb.13, noxious to punishment. Hear what Paul sayS, Obey them that
¹⁷⁶ leave the ναῖε over you, and submit yourselves: for they wateh 3
for your souls as they that must yive account. But dost ’ ³
thou desire honour and power? But what pleasure is there in ¹,

 

this honour? Ι confess, I see not. For to be a ruler indeed ’
Ι is not possible, since it depends upon those under thy rule ,
to obey or not. And to any one who considers the matter

closely, it will appear that a Bishop does not so much come
to rule, as to serve a multitude of masters, who are os oppo-
site (lesircs and sentiments. For what one commends.,¹ ·
