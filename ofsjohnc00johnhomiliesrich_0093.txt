present at thy actionS, and will One Day inquire into them,
to Whom all things are naked and open. It is on this ac—
count that we now urge these thingS, that we may not let
you be amenable to those severe judgmentS. Let us sear
therefore lest He reprove you in the words of the Prophet to
the J ewish women. They come to be seen of me wantoniny
and miminy as theyyo‚ and makinq a tinkliny wilk their
feet.

Ye have taken upon you a great contest, where wrestling,
not ornament, is required3 where the battle awaits you, not
sloth and ease. Observe the combatants and wrestlers in the
games. Do they concern themselves about their walk, or
their dress? No, but scorning all these, and throwing about
them a garmente dripping with oil, they look only to one thing,
to wound, and not be wounded. The devil stands grinding his
teeth, watching to destroy thee every way, and thou remainest
unconcerned, or concerned only about this satanic ornament.
I say nothing about the voice, though much affectationis shewn
in this aISO, nor about persumeS, and other such luxuries, l‘t
is for these things we are ridiculed by the women of the
world.¹ The respect for virginity is lost. No one honours
a virgin as she ought to be honoured. They have given
occasion to their own dishonour. Ought not they to be
looked up to in the Church of God, as women coming from
heaven? but now they are despised, and deservedly, though
not those among them who are discreet. But when one who
has a husband and children, and presides over a household,
sees thee, who ought to be crucified to the world, more de-
voted to the world than herself, will she not ridicule and de-
spise thee? See what care! what pains! In thy humble
dreSS, thou exceedest her who wears the costliest ornament,
and art more studious of appearance than she who is arrayed
in gold. What is becoming to thee thou seekest not3 that
which misbecomes thee thou pursuest, when thou oughtest
to be occupied in good works. On this account virgins are
less honoured than women of the world. For they do not
perform works worthy of their virgin profession. This is
not said to all; or rather it is said to all 3 to those who are in
fault, that they may learn modesty3 to those who are free
