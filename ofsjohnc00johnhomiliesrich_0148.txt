seest not there what is seen in a private house. That corn-
pany is free from all impurity. There is silence and profound
quiet. The words ‘ mine and thine' are not in use among
them. And if thou remainest there a whole day or even two,
the more pleasure thou wilt enjoy. There, as soon as it is
day, or rather before day, the cock crOWS, and you see it
not as you may see it¹ in a house, the servants snoring, the
deors shut, all sleeping like the dead, whilst the muleteer
without is 111131113 1115 bells. There is nothing of all this.
All, immediately shaking off sleep, reverently rise when their
President calls them, and forming themselves into a holy
611011, they stand, and lifting up their hands all at once sing
the sacred hymnS. For they are not like us, who require many
hours to shake off sleep from our heavy heads. We indeed,
as soon as we are awaked‚ sit some time stretching our limbs,

hands are always pure; for his sleep is composed and
regular. No one among them is found snoring or breathing
hard, or tossing about in sleep, or with his body exposed ;
but they lie in sleep as decently as those who are awake, and
all this is the effect of the orderly state of their souls. These
are truly saints and 3113615 among men. And marvel not when
you hear these things. For their 31631 sear of Grod suffers
them not to go down into the depths of sleep, and to drown
their mindS, but it falls lightly upon them, merely affording
them rest. And as their sleep 15, 511611 316 111611 (11631115, 1101

But, as Ι said, at the crowing of the cock their President
