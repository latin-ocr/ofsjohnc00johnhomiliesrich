According] to the saith of God's elect. Is it because thou
hast believed, or rather because thou wast intrusted? I
think he meant, that he was intrusted with God's elect, that
is, not for any achievements of mine, nor from my toils and
labourS, did I receive this dignity. It was wholly the effect
of His goodness who intrusted me. Yet that the grace may
not seem without reason, (for still the whole was not of Him,
for why did He not intrust it to others ?) he therefore adds,

intrusted to me, for He was the author of this also. Whence

For there is a truth in other things, that is not according to
godliness3 for knowledge in matters of agriculture, knowledge
of the artS, is true knowledge3 but this truth is after godli-
ness. Orthis, according] to saith, means that they believed,
as the other elect believed, and acknowledged the truth.
This acknowledging then is from saith, and not from reason-
