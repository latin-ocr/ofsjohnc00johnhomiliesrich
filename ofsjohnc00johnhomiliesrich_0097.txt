j} creature, one of the same kind, as by an inferior and 8111101·- HOM-

therefore with the woman, he is spoken of as not deceived.
v} For she was beguiled by an inferior and subject, he by an equal.
²} Again, it is not said of the man, that hc saw tlte tree was
yoodforfood, but of the woman, and that she did eat, and
qave it to ker husband: 80 that he transgressed, not captivated
, by appetite, but merely from the persuasion of his wife. The
woman taught once, and ruined all. On this account there-
fore he saith, let her not teach. But what is it to other wo-
⁴ men, that she suffered this? It certainly concerns them 3 for
2 the sex is weak and fickle, and he is speaking of the sex col-
{3 . lectively. For he says not Eve, but the woman, which is the
common name of the whole sex, not her proper name. Was
then the* whole sex included in the transgression for her
fault? As he said of Adam, After tlte similitude of Adam's Rom. 5,
Ξ transqression, wlio is tlte fiyure of Him that was to come ; ¹4·
so here the female sex transgressed, and not the male. Shall
not women then be saved? Yes, by means of children. For
it is not of Eve that he sayS, [f they continue in faitlz and

charity? what holiness with sobriety? It is as if he had said,
“J ‘ Ye women, be not cast down, because your sex has incurred
¹* blame. God has granted you another opportunity of salva-
5„ tion, by the bringing up of children, so that you are saved,
L not only by yourselves, but by others.’ See how many ques-
'j tions are involved in this matter. T ke woman, he sayS, being)
js deceived was in tlte transyression. What woman? Eve. Shall
she then be saved by child-bearing? He does not say that,
⁵² > but, therace of women shall be saved. Was not it then in-
volved in transgression? Ῡ68, it waS, still Eve transgressed,
but the whole sex shall be saved, notwithstanding, by child-
beariny. And why not by their own persona] virtue? For has
she excluded others from this salvation? And what will be
the case with virgins, with the barren, with widows who have
, 1081 their husbands‚ before they had children? will they perish?
³ is there no hope for them? yet virgins are held in the highest
estimation. What then does he mean to say?

Some interpret his meaning thuS. Α8 what happened to (Q)
the first woman occasioned the subjection of the wh'ole sex,
