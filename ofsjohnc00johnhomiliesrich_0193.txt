ζ These things which he before prayed for, he again invokes

s excuses himself for not having come to him, nor seen him.

 

,1 For his wordS, Till I come, and, Hopz‘ny to come to thee
ῥ’ shortly, had led Timothy to expect his coming soon. For
this he excuses himself, but he does not immediately mention

the cause of his not coming, lest he should grieve him

’ mightily, For he was detained in prison by the emperor.

But when at the end of the Epistle he invited him to come

’5 to him, then he informed him of it. He does Ποῖ at the

s outset plunge him into sorrow, but encourages the hope that

³ for he had not violated his conscience. And here he speaks
ζ of his blameless life, for he every where calls his life his
conscience. Or because I never gave up any good that I

mends his own disposition, that his love may appear sincere.
a For what he says is in fact, ‘ I am Ποῖ false, I do not think
ῗ, one thing and profess another? So in the book of Acts we
read he was compelled to praise himself. For when they
