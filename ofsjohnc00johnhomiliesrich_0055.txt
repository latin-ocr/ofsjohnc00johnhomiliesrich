because he does the work of God. And we think that we
envy him, but our envy passes on to Christ. We affect to
wish the benefit to come not from otherS, but from ourselveS.

But this cannot be for Christ’s sake, but for our own: other-
wise, it would be a matter of indifference‚ whether the good
were done by others or ourselves. If va physician found him-

self unable to cure his son, who was threatened with blind-
ness, would he reject the aid of another, who was able to
effect the cure? Far from it! ‘ Let my son be restored,’ he

Itis not for the Lord's sake, but for the sake of the man’s
kind speech that you do it. Has any one injured you? Do

him good! for in benefiting him who has benefited you,
there is little merit. Have you been deeply wronged and
suffered loss? Make a point of requiting it with the contrary.
YeS, I entreat you, Let this be the way we do our own part.

Let us cease from hating and injuring our enemies. He com-
