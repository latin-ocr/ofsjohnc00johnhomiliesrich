mg from man. For a1i''Apostle²'‘²² can say nothing of his own, ·

accordiny to the commandment of God our Saviour. Now Ἴ
it does not appear that the Father any where commanded Ξ
him. It is every where Christ who addresses him. Thus,
He said mtto me, Depart, for I will send thee far hence ‚⁵

unio the Gentiles; and again, Thou must be brouyht before
Caesar. But whatever the Son commandS, this he ,cOnsiders
to be the commandment of the F ather, as those of the Spirit
are the commandments of the Son. For he was sent by the
spirit, he was separated by the spirit, and this he says was

the commandment of God. What then? does it derogate ’
srom the power of the Son, that His Apostle was sent forth ’

by the commandment of the Father? By no means. For
observe, how he represents the power as common to Both.

For having said, according] to tlte commandment qf God our ’

Saviour; he adds, and Lord Jesus Christ, om· hope. ’ And

observe, with what propriety he applies the titlesb. And

indeed, the Psalmist applies this to the F ather, saying, The

hope of alc the ends of the earth. And again, the blessed Ι

Paul in another place writeS, For therefore 'we both labour,

and suffer reproach, because we have hope in tlte liviny' God. ᾗ

For I will amite the sleepherd, (he says) and the sheep¹ shall ἰ

violence agai‘nst teacherS, because by their destruction the .

flock also is scattered. For by slaying the sheep, he has
lessened the flock, but when he has made away with the
shepherd, he has ruined the whole flock, so that he the
rather assaults him, as working greater mischief by a less
effort3 and in one soul effecting the ruin of all. For this

reason Paul, at the beginning, elevates and encoun-igess*¹ the ,ι
