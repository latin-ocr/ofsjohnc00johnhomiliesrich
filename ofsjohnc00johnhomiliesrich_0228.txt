What is greater in the common estimation of glory than to
be reputed a god? It is indeed a great disgrace that any
human being should be so mad, but for the present let us
consider the matter according to the opinion of the multitude.
Nothing then was wanting to him, that contributes to human
glory, but he was worshipped by all as a god. Now in
opposition to him, let us consider Paul. He was a Cilician,
and the difference between Rome and Cilicia, all know.
He was a tent-maker, a poor man, unskilled in the wisdom
of those without, knowing only the Hebrew tongue‚ a
language despised by all, especially by the Italians. For
they do not so much despise the Barbarian, the Greek, or
any other tongue as the Syriac, and this has affinity with ¹
the Hebrew. Nor wonder at this, for if they despised the
Greek, which is so admirable and beautiful, much more the
Hebrew. He was a man that often lived in hunger, often
· went to bed without food, a man that was naked, and had
not clothes to put on3 in colel, and nakedness, as he says of
himself. Nor was this all; but he was cast into prison at
the command of Nero himself, and confined with robberS,
with impostorS, with grave-breakers, with murdererS, and he
waS, as he himself sayS, scourged as a malefactor. Who
then is the more illustrious,? The name of the one the
greater part have never heard of. The other is daily cele-
brated by Greeks, and BarbarianS, and ScythianS, and those

who inhabit the extremities of the earth.
But let us not yet consider what is the case nOW, but even

at that time who was the more illustrious, who the more
glorious, he that was in chainS, and dragged bound from
prison, or he that was clothed in a purple robe, and walked
forth from a palace? The prisoner certainly. For the other,
who had armies at his command, and sat arrayed in purple,
was not able to do what he would. But the prisoner, that
was like a malefactor, and in mean attire, could do every
thing with more authority. How? The one said, “ Do not
disseminate the word of God.” The other said, “ I cannot
forbear3 the word of God is not bound.” Thus the Cilician,
the prisoner, the poor tent-maker, who lived inr hunger,
