which is always filling, never satisfied, but still craving. If

it were necessary to drink hellebore, or submit to any thing a
thousand times worse, would it not be worth our while to
undertake it readily, that we might be delivered from this
passion? There is no abundance of riches that can fill the
belly of greediness. And shall we not be ashamed, that men

no limit to their love, be it never so great, but we, if we
have done ever so little, think that we have fulfilled every
thing. We love not God as much, nc, not by many times
over so much, as they love gold. Their inordinate rage for
