the same honour. But some are to honour and some to ΗΘΜ·
dishonour. ‘ Nay,’ says one, ‘in a house they may be of VI.
’ί some use, but not at all in the world.' 'Though God employs
³ them not for such honourable service, he makes use of them
v,for other purposeS. For instance, the vainglorious man
ἑ *builds much, so does the covetous man, the merchant, the
tradesman, the magistrate3 there are certain works in the
'world suited to these. But the golden vessel is not of such
a nature. It is employed about the royal table. He does
ῗ not say however that wickedness is a necessary thing, (for
· how should it be ?) but that the wicked also have their work.
, For if all were of gold or of silver, there would be no need
of the viler sort. For instance, if all were hardy, there would

became an earthen one. The earthen vessels, therefore, are
such from uncleanness. The fornicator and the covetous

to say that our body is an earthen vessel, For as earthen-
ware is nothing else but baked clay, so is our body nothing
but clay consolidated by the heat of the soul; for that it is
earthen, is evident. For as such a vessel is often by falling
broken and dashed to pieces, so our body salls and is dis-
