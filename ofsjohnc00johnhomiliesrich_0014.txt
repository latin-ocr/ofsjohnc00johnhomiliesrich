iv PREFACE.

Those on the Epistle to Philemon cannot easily be as-
signed to any particular date. The promise he mentions in
the last Homily, p. 360. does not seem to afford a clue to it,
but may possibly do so. The composition of these Ho-
milies has been remarked on as negligent by Hemsterhusius‚
so that he takes them to have been extemporaneous effia-
sions taken down by others. There may be some ground for
this in the style, and in the paraphrastic character of the
various readings, but as a commentary they are unusually
close and exact, and point out much of what regards the
persuasive character of the Epistle that is not generally
noticed.

For the Translation and some illustrative notes, the Editors
are indebted to the Rev. J AMES TWEED, M.A. of Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge. The text of the New Paris edition has
been chiefly used, as it is improved from the Benedictine.
Savile's has been compared with it in many parts, and in every
difficulty, and where both failed, a better reading has been
sometimes found in the MS. marked Β, which is in the British
Museum marked Burney 48. The differences are however
slight, and affect the Greek more than the Translation. A
Venice MS. which usually agrees with this, has been collated
for the Homilies on the Epistle to Philemon. An old Latin
version published at Basle has been noticed in some placeS,
where its 'variations appear to be derived from Greek copies.
