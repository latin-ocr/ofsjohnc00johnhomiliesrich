Beloved, let us be ashamed, let us fear. Let us only serve
our Master, as our servants serve us. Rather not even ¹¹ the
smallest portion of service do we render! Necessity makes
them philosopherS. They have only food and lodging3 but
we,possessing much and expecting more,insult our Benefactor
with our luxury. If from nothing else, from them at least
let us learn the rules of philosophy. The Scripture is wont
to send men not even to servantS, but to irrational creatureS,
as when it bids us imitate the bee and the ant. But I advise
you but to imitate servants: only so much as they do from
fear of their masterS, let us do from the fear of God3 for I
cannot find that you do even this. They receive many
insults from fear of US, and endure them in silence with >the
patience of philosophers. Justly or unjustly they are ex·-
posed to our violence, and they do not resist, but entreat US,
though often they have done nothing wrong. They are
contented to receive no more and often less than they need;
with straw ² for their bed, and only bread for their food, they
do not complain or murmur at their hard living, but through
fear of us are restrained from impatience. When they are
entrusted with money, they restore it all. For I am not
speaking of the worthleSS, but of the moderately good. If
we threaten them, they are at once awed.

Is not this philosophy? For say not they are under
necessity, When thou too art under a necessity in the fear of
hell. And yet dost thou not learn wisdom, nor render to
God as much honour, as thou receivest from thy servants·
Of thy servants each has the apartment assigned to him by
thy ruleS, and he does not invade that of his neighbour, nor
do any injury from a desire of more than he has· This
