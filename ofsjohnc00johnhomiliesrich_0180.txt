154 Love of money a universal madness.

1 Tm. against the poor and wretched, or rather against our own
6,12. souls, and to the high displeasure of God. For as for the

 

other, a man robs him of his wealth, and reduces him to
poverty, but himself to death 3 and him he causes to pine in
penury here, but himself in that eternal punishment. Are
they equal sufferers, think you ?

What evils then does it not cause! what fraudulent
practices, what robberies! what miserieS, enmitieS, conten-
tions, battles! Does it not stretch forth its hand even to
the dead, nay, to fatherS, and brethren? Do not they who Ἴ
are possessed by this passion violate the laws of nature, and ³
the commandments of God? in short every thing? Is it not
this that renders our courts of justice necessary? Take away
therefore the love of money, and you put an end to war, to
battle, to enmity, to strife and contention. Such men ought
therefore to be banished from the world, as wolves and pests,
For as opposing and violent windS, sweeping over a calm
sea, stir it up from its foundations, and ‘mingle the sands of
the deep with the waves above, so the lovers of wealth con-
found and unsettle every thing. The covetous man never
knows a friend: a friend, did I say? he knows not God Him-
self, driven mad, as he is, by the passion of avarice. Do ye
not see the Titans going forth sword in hand? This is a
representation of madness, But the lovers of money do not
counterfeit, they are really mad, and beside themselves 3 and
if you could lay bare their soUIS, you would find them armed
in this way not with one or two swords, but with thousands‚
acknowledging no one, but turning their rage against all;
fiying and snarling at all, slaughtering not dogs g, but the souls
of men, and uttering blasphemies against heaven itself. By
these men all things are subverted, and ruined by their mad-
ness after wealth.

For whom indeed, whom I should accuse, I know not! It
is a plague that so seizes all, some more, some leSS, but all in
adegree. Like a fire catching a wood, that desolates and
destroys all around, this passion has laid waste the world.
Kings, magistrateS, private personS, the poor, women, men,
