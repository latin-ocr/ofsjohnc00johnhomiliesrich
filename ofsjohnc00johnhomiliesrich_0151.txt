Deam and sickuess z'n a Monastery. 1⁶25

Ἴ 116 deprived, no wealth, but a soul and body, of which if they Hom-

There is no such thing to be heard there as wailing and (5)
lamentation. Their roof is free from that melancholy and

those eries. Deaths happen there indeed, for their bodies
are not immortal, but they know not death, as death. The
