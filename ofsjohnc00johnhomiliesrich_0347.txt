Know ye not that often, when a physician despairs of a sick
man, some relative standing by addresses him, ‘ Bestow
further attendance, leave nothing undone, that I may not
have to accuse myself‚ that Ι may incur no blame, no self—
ι reproach.' Do you not see the great care that near kinsmen
take of their relations, how much they do for them, both
intreating the physicians to cure them, and sitting persever-
ingly beside them? Let us at least imitate them. And yet
there is no comparison between the objects of our concern.
For if any one had a son diseased in his body, he could not
Α resuse to take a long journey to free him from his disease.

we become sensible of it. Consider how disgraceful auding-
¹ absurd it is to say afterwards, ‘ we never looked for it, we
never expected that this would be the event.' And it is no
less dangerous than disgraceful. For if in the present life
it is the part of foolish men to make no provision for the
future, much more must it be so with respect to the next life,
when we hear many counselling us, and informing us what is
s to be done, and what not to be done. Let us then hold fast
2 that hope ¹¹¹. Let us be careful of our salvation‚ let us in all
things call-upon God, that He may stretch forth His hand to
118. How long will you be slothful? How long negligent?
How long shall we be careless of ourselves and of our fellow-
servants? He hath shed richly upon us the grace of His
Spirit. Let us therefore consider how great is the grace
he has bestowed upon 118, and let us shew as great eamestness
ourselveS, or, since this is not possible, some, although it be
less. For if after this grace we are insensible‚ the heavier
will be our punishment. For {f I, He says, had not come John15
