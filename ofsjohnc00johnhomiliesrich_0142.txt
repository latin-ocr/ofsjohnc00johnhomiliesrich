Wherefore? Because the latter, if he benefits not aliens,
does not neglect his near kindred. What is meant is this:
The law of God and of nature is violated by him who
provides not for his own family. But if he who provides not

kindred, as to neglect a stranger. How should it be? But
the fault is greater here, to desert one known *than one who
is unknown to ηε, a friend than one who is not a friend.
