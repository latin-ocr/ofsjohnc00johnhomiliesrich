254 St. Paal's Conflict, Race, and Crown.

2 ΤΙΜ. end. This is not of olive leaves. It has not a human·
4, 8· umpire. It has not men for spectatorS. The theatre is
crowded with AngeIS. There men labour many dayS, and
suffer hardships, and for one hour they receive the crown,
and immediately all the pleasure passes away. But here far
otherwise, it continues for ever in brightneSS, glory, and
honour. Henceforth we ought to rejoice. For I am enter-
ing on my rest, I am leaving the race. Thou hast heard that

it is better to depart and to be with Christ.

Ι have finished my course. For it behoves us both to contend
and to run3 to contend, by enduring afflictions firmly, and to
run, not vainly, but to some good end. Itis truly a good
fight, not only delighting, but benefiting the spectator: and
the race does not end in nothing. It is not a mere display
of strength and of rivalry. It draws all up to heaven. This
race is brighter than the sun'S, yea, this which Paul ran upon

rather more swiftly than a bird: for a bird only flies over it,
but he, having the wing of the spirit, made his way through
numberless impediments, dangers, deaths, and calamitieS, so
that he was even fleeter than a bird. Had he been a mere
bird, he might have alighted and been taken, but being up-
borne by the Spirit he soared above all snareS, as a bird with
a wing of fire.

 

I have kept tlzefaitlz, he sayS. There were many things ἲ
that would have robbed him of it, not only human friendshipS,
but menaces and deathS, and countless other perils: but he
stood firm against all. How? by being sober and watchful.
This might have sufficed for the consolation of his discipleS,
buthe further adds the rewardS. And what are these ?

Ver. 8. Hencefortlz there is laid up for me a crown (ff
righteousneSS.

Here again he calls virtue in general righteousness. Thou
shouldest not grieve that I shall depart, to be invested with-y ¹
that crown which will by Christ be placed upon my heads
