Aye of Churck-widows. Duties of women. 117

Having mentioned the qualities which not to have would Hom.

render a woman unworthy to be reckoned among the widows,
he now mentions what she ought to have besides. What
then? are we to receive her for her years? What merit is
'z there in that? It is not her own doing that she is threescore
’ἶ years old. Therefore he does not speak of her age merely,
ἑ as, if she has even reached those years„ she may not yet, he
⁸ sayS, without good workS, be reckoned among the number,
’ But why then is ‘he particular about the age ? He afterwards
assigns a cause not originating with himself, but with the
¹ widows themselves. Meanwhile let us hear what follows.
Well reported osfor qood worlcS, if she have brouqlzt up
children. Truly, it is no unimportant work to bring up
Ἴ children3 but bringing them up is not merely taking care
ῑ of them ; they must be brought up we113 as he said before,

serve how constantly he sets kindnesses to our own relatives
before those to strangerS. First, he sayS, If she have brouylil
up children, then, If she leave lodqed stranyers, if she have

she have diligently followed every yood work. But what if
she be poor? Not even in that case is she debarred from
bringing up children, lodging strangers, relieving the afflicted.
She is not more destitute than the widow who gave the two
mites. Poor though she be, she has an house, she does not
lodge in the open air. If, he sayS, slge'have waslied the Saints’
feet. This is not a costly work. If she leave diliyently

He exhorts them to contribute bodily service, for women are
peculiarly fitted for such attendance‚ for making the bed of
the sick, and composing them to rest.

Strange! what strictness does he require of widows;
almost as much as of the Bishop himself. For he says,
If she have diliqently followed every qood work. This is as
though he meant that, if she could not of herself perform it,
she shared and co-operated in it. When he cuts off luxury,
he would have her provident, a good economist, and at the
same time continually persevering in prayer. Such was
Anna. Such strictness does he require of widows. Greater
,even than of virginS‚ from whom he yet requires much
