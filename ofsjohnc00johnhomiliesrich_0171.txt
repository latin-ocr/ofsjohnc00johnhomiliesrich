But if he exhorts servants to render such implicit obedience, Momm.
’ consider what ought to be our disposition towards our Master,
who brought us into existence out of nothing, and who feeds
and clothes us. If in no other way then, let us render Him
f service at least as our servants render it to us. Do not they
order their whole lives to afford rest to their masterS, and is it
