man may be called disorderly and intemperate. For avarice
is' a lust no less than the bodily appetiteS, which he who does

the envious, the covetOUS, the deceitful, and every one that
lives 111 sin, may be called dissolute, disorderly, and licentious..

(ρ) Imitate God! if He will have all men to be saved, there is
reason why one should pray for all, if He hath willed that all
should be saved, be thou willing also; and if thou wishest it,
pray for it, for wishes lead to prayers. Observe how from
every quarter He urges this upon the soul, to pray for the H ea-
then, shewing how great advantage springs from it3 ‘that we
may lead a quiet (mdpeaoeable life& and what is much more
than this, that it is pleasing to God, that thus men become
like Him, in that they will-the same that He does. This is
enough to shame a very brute. Fear not therefore to pray
for the GentileS, for God Himself wills it; but fear only to
pray against any, for that He wills not. And if you pray for
the HeathenS, you ought of course to pray for Heretics
also, for we are to pray for all men, and not to persecuteb.
And this is good also for another reason, as we are partakers
of the same nature, and God commands and accepts benevo-
lence and affection towards one another. ῃ

of my prayer? It is of great benefit both to them and to.
