214 Consciencesreed by sickness. Spiritual medicine.

here, the soul enjoying itself, does not tolerate painful
thoughts ε but when it is about to take its flight from
the body, then a greater fear constrains it, as entering into
the very portals of judgment. Even robberS, whilst they are
in prison, live without sear, but when they are brought to the
very curtain of the court¹ , they sink with terror. For when
the fear of death is urgent, like a fire consuming all things -
besides, it obliges the soul to philosophize, and to take thought
for futurity. The desire of wealth, the love of gain, and of
bodily pleasureS, no longer possesses it. These things passing
away like cloudS, leave the judging faculty clear, and grief
entering in softens the hard heart. For nothing is so opposite
to philosophy, as a life of pleasure3 nor, on the other hand,
is any thing so favourable to philosophy as affliction. Consider
what the covetous man will then be. For, an. hom· of afflic-
tion, it is said, malceth a manforqet mach pleat-sare. What
will then be his state, when he considers those whom he has
robbed, and injured, and defrauded, when he sees others reap- ·
ing the fruits of his grasping, and himself going to pay the ³
penalty. For it cannot, indeed it cannot be, that when fallen
into sickness he should not reflect upon these things. For
often the soul of itself is distracted with agony and terror.
What a bitterness is this, tell me! And with every sickness
these things must be endured. And what will he not suffer
when he sees others punished or put to death ?

These things await him here. And as to what he must
undergo hereaster, it is not possible to say what punishment,
what vengeance, what torments‚ what racks are reserved for
him There. These things we declare. He tlzat Izatlz ears to
hear, let lzim hear. We are for ever discoursing of these
thingS, not willingly, but of necessity. For we could wish
there were no obligation to mention such things at all. But
since it must be, we would at least, by a little medicine,
deliver you from your disease‚ and restore you to health.
But whilst you remain in this sickness, it would shew a mean
and weak spirit, not to say cruelty and inhumanity, to desist
from the healing treatment. For if when physicians despair
of our bodieS, we beseech them not to neglect ηε, not to
cease to our last breath applying whatever is in their power,
shall we not much more exhort ourselves? For perhaps
