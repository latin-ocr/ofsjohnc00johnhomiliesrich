294 God teaches men tho-ouyh what they know.

Tuus paths are full of Jove, the sea is full'··—-adds›, For we boo are
{Lm-14. His offisprin9‚ in which I cono-eive he shews that we are
sprung from God. How then does Paul wrest what is said
of Jupiter to the God of the universe ? He has not transferred
to God what belongs to Jupiter. But what is applicable to

God, and was neither justly nor properly applied to Jupiter,
this he restores to God, since the name of God belongs to

Him alone, and is not lawfully bestowed upon idols.

 

And from what writers should he address them ? From the ’
Prophets? They would not have believed them. Since with ¹

the Jews too he does not argue from the GospeIS, but from
ὲοῗὲἳξ), the ProphetS. For this reason he sayS, Unto the Jews I
law, to those that are under tlte Law, as ander the Law.

(2) Thus does God too, as in the case of the wise men, He does

became as a Jew, to them that are without law, as without

not conduct them by an Angel, nor a Prophet, nor an Apostle, Σ
nor an Evangelist, but how ? By a star. For as their art made ;
them conver-sant with these, He made use of such means to
guide them. So in the case of the oxen‚ that drew the ark. „j

Sam. ff it yoetlz up by tlze way Qf his own coast, then He lzatlz done ᾗ
· us this yreat evil, as their prophets suggested. Do these .

prophets then speak the truth? No ; but he refutes and con·- ’Ξ
founds them out of their own mouths. Again, in the case of ’
the witoh, because Saul believed in her, he caused him to 2.
hear through her what was about to besall him. Why then
Aetam, did Paul stop the mouth of the spirit, that said, These men
¹7· are tlte servants os the most lziylz God, which skew unto us ὲ
tlte way of salvation P And why did Christ hinder the ἶ

devils from speaking of Him? In this case there was reason,
since the miracles were going on. For here it was not a star
that proelaimed Him, but He Himself 3 and the demens
again were not w01·shipped⁰; for it was not an image thaz
spoke, that it should be forbidden. He also suffered Balaam
to bless, and did not restrain him. Thus He every where
condescendS.

And what wonder? for He permitted opinions erroneouS,
and unworthy of Himself, to prevail, as that He was a body
formerly ἁ, and that He was visible. In opposition to which

Ξ ize: by Saul. l sam. 28, 8: time when the opinions were allowed to
'Ihrs word seems to mser to the prevail.
