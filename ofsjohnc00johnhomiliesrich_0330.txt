304 The Teacher's duty, Power of his Example.

 

and dost not allow him to blaspheme Christianity3 and this is .
no mean thing, but great indeed, that the doctrine should be ¹
admired through our conversat-ion. ’ἑ

Ver. 6. Y onny men likewise exhort to be soberminded. 4

See how he every where recommends the observance of ε
decorum. For he has committed to women the greater part l
in the instruction of women, having appointed the elder to j
teach the younger. But the whole instruction of men he
assigns to Titus himself. For nothing is so difficult for that
age as to overcome unlawful pleasures. For neither the love ,ι
of wealth, nor the desire of glory, or any other thing so much j

Ver. 7. In all thinys shewinq thysetf a pattern of qood ⁵

In doctrine shewz'ny uncorrnptness, qravity‚ sincerity. ι

By him that is of the contrary part, he means the devil,
and every one who ministers to him. For when the life is
illustrious‚ and the discourse corresponds to it, being meek
and gentle, and affording no handle to the adversaries, it is
of unspeakable advantage. Of great use then is the ministry
of the word, not any common word, but that which is
approved, and cannot be condemned, affording no pretext to
those who are willing to censure it.

Ver. 9. Eoeleort servants to be obedient to their own
masters, and to please them well in all thinys.
