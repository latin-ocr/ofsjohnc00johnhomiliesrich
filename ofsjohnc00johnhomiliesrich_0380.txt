354 Om· utmost humiliation a due to Christ,

Pau.. For hear Paul saying, Sin worketk death in me by that which
l' ¹⁶2ss qood, tlzat sin by tlze commandment miykt become exceed- ,
ἕξω ⁷² inq sinful. When it enters into thy thought to admire thyself ’

because thou art humble, consider thy Master, to what He

descended, and thou wilt no longer admire thyself, nor praise

thyself‚ but wilt deride thyself as having done nothing. Con·

sider thyself altogether to be a debtor. Whatever thou hast

From done, remember that parable, Which ofyou leavinq a servan-t

{luge 17, . . . will say unio him, when he is come in, Sit down to meat?

 

. . . I say unio you, Nay. . . bat stay and serve me. Do we
return thanks to our servants, for waiting upon us? By no
means. Yet God is thankful to us, who serve not Him, but>
do that which is expedient for ourselves.

But let not us be so affected, as if He owed us thankS, that
He may owe us the more, but as if we were discharging a
debt. For the matter truly is a debt, and all that we do is of
debt. Foris when we purchase slaves with our money, we
wish them to live altogether sor US, and whatever they have
to have it for ourselveS, how much more must it be so with
Him, who brought us out of nothing into being, who after
this bought us with His precious Blood, who paid down such
a· price for us as no one would endure to pay for his own son,
who shed His own Blood for us? [f therefore we had ten
thousand souls, and should lay them all down> for Him, should
we make Him an equal return? By no means. And why?
Because He did this, owing us nothing, but the whole was a
matter of grace. But we henceforth are debtors: and being·
God Himself, He became a servant, and not being subject to
death, subjected Himself to death in the fiesh. We, if we do
not lay down our lives for Him‚ by the law of nature must
certainly lay them down, and a little later shall be separated
from it⁰, however unwillingly. So also in the case of richeS, if
we do not bestow them for His sake, we shall render them up
from necessity at our end. So it is also with humility. Al-
though we are not humble for His sake, we shall be made
humble by tribulationS, by calamitieS, by over-ruling powers,
Seest thou therefore how great is the grace! He hath not
said, ‘ What great thing do the Martyrs do ?’ Although

⁰ 'the sense naturally leads to this uncommon in St. Chrysostom. See
transrtlon to the singular, which is not p. 305. 1. 21.
