162 Slaveoy to Passiones mosam-eteleed in yreameas:

1 Tm· not even his crown has power to deliver him from their sub· 2
6, 21. jection. As isone who had been a king should be reduced
to slavery by barbarianS, and they wishing to shew their ,
power the more absolutely, should not strip him of his purple
robe and his diadem, but oblige him to work in them, and to
perform all menial offiees, to draw water, and to eook their
food, that his disgraee and their honour might be the more
apparent τ so do our passions domineer over us more barba· ε
rously than any barbarians. For he that despises them ean
despise the barbarians too 3 but he that submits to them, will
suffer more severely than from barbarianS. The barbarian,
when his power prevails, may afflict the body, but these pas· ’
sions torture the soul, and lacerate it all over. When the
barbarian has prevailed, he delivers one to tempora] death,
but these to that which is to come. So that he alone is the
free man, who has his freedom in himself 3 and he who sub-
mits to these unreasonable passionS, is the slave.

No master, however inhuman, imposes such severe and ’
inhuman commands. They say to him, in effect, ‘ Disgrace
thy soul without end or object,-—0ffend thy God,-—be deas to
the elaims of nature, though it be thy father or thy mother,

be not ashamed to set thyself against them.’ Such are the

 

commands of avariee. ‘ Sacrifice to me, she says, not calves,
Hosea but men.' The prophet indeed sayS, Sacriflce men, for
lfflgx the calx-es have failed. But avariee says, ⁶ Sacrifice men,
though there are yet calveS. Sacrifice those who have never ³
injured thee, yea slay them, though they have. been thy
benefactors.⁷ Or again, ⁶ Be at war, and go about as the eom-
mon enemy of all, of nature herself, and of God. Heap up
gold, not that thou mayest enjoy it, but that thou mayest
keep it, and work greater torture to thyself.’ For it is not
possible that the lover of money should be able to enjoy it,
since he fears lest his gold should be diminished, lest his
hoards should fail. ⁶ Be watchsul‚’ it says, ⁶ be suspicions of ’
every one, even domestics and friends. Have an eye to the
goods of other men. Though you see the poor man perish-
ing with hunger, give him nothing3 but strip him, if it be
possible, even of his skin. Break thine oaths, lie, swear. Be
an accuser, a false informer. Refuse not, if it be necessary,

to rush into fire, to submit to a thousand deaths„to perish
