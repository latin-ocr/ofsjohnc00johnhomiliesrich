1 TtM. If the devil, that wicked spirit, that crafty confounder of all
2,7. things,‚has no power¹, what power has money? When
you look upon silver, fancy it is tin! Cannot you? Then

hold it for what it really is3 sor earth it is. But if you
cannot reason thus, consider that we too shall perish, that
many of those who have possessed it have gained scarce any
advantage by it, that thousands who gloried it it are now

dust and ashes. That they are suffering extreme punish-
ment, and far more beggarly thau they that fed from glass

and earthenware3 that those who once reclined on ivory
coucheS‚ are poorer now than those who are lying on the
dunghill. But it delights the eyes! How many other things
delight them more l The flowerS, the pure sky, the firmament,

the bright sun, are far more grateful to the eye. For it hath
much of rust, whence some have asserted that it was black,
which appears from the images that turn black. But there is

no blackness in the sun, the heaven, the stars. Much
greater delight is there in these brilliants ¹¹² than in its colour.

flower covetousness and iniquity 3 these, and not money, give the

precious will seem to thee more worthless than clay. Those

 

who are in a sever long for mud when they see it, as if it
were spring water3 but those in sound health seldom wish
even for water. Cast off this morbid longing, and thou wilt
see things as they are. And to prove that I do not speak
falsely, know, that I can point out many who have done so.
Quench this flame, and thou wilt see that these things are of
less worth than flowers.

Is gold good? YeS, it is good for almsgiving, for the
relies of the poor; it is good, not for unprofitable use, to be
hoarded up or buried in the earth, to be worn on the hands
or the feet or the head. It was discovered sor this end, that
with it we should loose the captives, not form it into a chain
for the image of God. Use thy gold for this, to loose him
that is bound, not to chain her that is free. Tell me, why
dost thou value above all things what is of so little worth?
Is it the less a chain, because it is of gold ? does the material
