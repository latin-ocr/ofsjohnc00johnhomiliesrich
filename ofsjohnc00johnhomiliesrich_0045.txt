Vanity of Gold and Sillcs. Spiritual Pewfume. 19

of its enjoyment. Dost thou see what an unstable thing it HOM-
is, this glory of the present life ? Thou pridest thyself upon -
that which insects make and destroy. For Indian insectS,
it is said, spin those fine threads of whichyour robes are
made. But rather seek a clothing woven from things above,
an admirable and radiant vesture, raiment of real gold3 of
gold not dug by malefactors' hands out of the mine, but the
produce of virtue. Let us clotheourselves with a robe not
the manufacture of poor men or slaves, but wrought by our
Lord Himself. But your garmentS, you say, are in-wrought
with gold! And what is that to thee? He that wrought it,
not he that wears it, is the object of admiration, sor there it
is really due. It is not the fiame on‘ which the garment is
stretched at the suller'S, but the maker of it, that is admired.

 

Yet the block wears it, and has it bound on itself. And as
that wears it, but not for use, even so do some of these women,
for the benefit of the garment‚ to air it, they say, that it may
not be moth-eaten! Is it not then the extreme of folly to be
solicitous about a thing so worthleSS, to do any thing what-
ever, to risk your salvation for it, to make a mock at Hell, to
set God at defiance, to overlook Christ hungering? Talk not
of the precious spices of India, Arabia, and Persia, the moist
and the dry, the persumes and unguentS, so costly and
so useless. Why, O woman, dost thou lavish persumes upon
a body full of impurity within? why spend on what is offen-
sive, as if one should waste persumes upon dirt, or distil balms
upon a brick. There is, if you desire it, a precious ointment
and a fragrance, with which you might anoint your sou13 not
brought from Arabia, or Ethiopia, nor stom Persia, but from
heaven itself 3 purchased not by gold, but by a virtuous will,
and by faith unfeigned. Buy this persume, the odour of
which is able to ffll the world. It was of this the Apostles
savoured. For we are (he says) a sweet savour, to some of 2 Cor.
death, to others of life. And what means this? That it is as 2⁷ ¹5³⁶·
they say, that the swine is suffocated by persumes ! But this
spiritual fragrance scented not only the bodies but the gar-
ments of the Apostles3 and Paul's garments were so impreg-
nated with it, that they cast out devils. What balmy leaf,
what cassia, what myrrh so sweet or so efficacious as this
pei-sume? Foris it put devils to ssight, what‘could it not
