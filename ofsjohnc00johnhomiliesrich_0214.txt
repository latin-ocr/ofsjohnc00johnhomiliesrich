and was not aslzamed of my chain. But, when he was in
Rome, lte souyht me out diliqently, and found me. Observe
how he every where speaks of the shame, and not of the dan-
ger, lest Timothy should be alarmed. And yet it was a
thing that was full of peril. For he gave offence to Nero by
making friends with one of his prisonerS. But when he
was in Rome, he sayS, he not only did not shun intercourse
with me, but souyht me out very dileyemly, awd found me.

The Lord ,qrant unio kim that he mayfind mercy of tlze

Such ought the faithful to be. Neither sear, nor threatS,
nor disgrace, should deter them from assisting one another,
standing by them and succouring them as iu war. For they
do not so much benefit those who are in danger, as themselveS,

nica ye sent once and ayain unte my necessity. And how
could they that were far off share in the affliction of him that
was not with them ? How? He sayS, ye sentence and ayain
unto my neces-sities. Again he sayS‚ speaking of Epaphro-
ditus, Because he was niyk unte death, not reyardinq leis life,
that he miylzt supply your laclc Qf service toward me. For
as in the service of kings, not only those who fight the
battle, but those who guard the baggage, share in the honour3
and not merely sc, but frequently even have an equal portion “
of the spoiIS, though they have not imbrued their hands in
blood, nor stood in array, nor even seen the ranks of the
