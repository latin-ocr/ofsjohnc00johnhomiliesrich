'132 Clerqy not to be stinted-not to sparo themselves,

1 T1u.how does he quote from Christ? The labourer is worthy of
δ’ 16 his reward. Let us not then look only to the reward, but to
the terms of the commandment.17oe labourer, he sayS, is
worthy of lais reward. So that if any one lives in sloth
and luxury, he is unworthy of it. Unless he is as the ox
treading out the corn, and bearing the yoke, in spite of heat
and thorns, and ceases not till he has carried the corn into
the granary‚ he is not worthy. Therefore to teachers should
be granted a supply of their necessities without grudging‚
that they may not faint nor be discouraged, nor by attention
to inferior things deprive themselves of greater3 that they may
labour for spiritual things, paying no regard to worldly things.
It was thus with the Levites3 they had no worldly concernS,
because the laity took care to provide for them, and their re-
venues were appointed by the law, as tytheS, offerings of gold ⁶,
first fruits, vows, and many other things· And the law pro-
perly assigned these things to them, as seeking things present.
But I shall say no more than that those who preside ought

 

to have food and raiment, that they may not be distracted by

care for these things. But what is double support? Double

that of the widows, or of the deacons, or simply, liberal sup-

port. Let us not then think only of the double maintenance

granted them, but of what is added, leose who ναῖε well.

And what is it to rule well? Let us hear Christ, Who says,

John10,The qood shepleerd yivetle, his life jor his sheep. Thus to

selveS.

Especially those who labom· in the word and doctrine.

Where then are those who say that there is no occasion for the

1T‘m.4, word and doctrine? Whereas he says to Timothy, Meditate

15.16. upon these thirty& yive tlzyself wholly to them; and, Give

attendam-e to readiwq, to exhortation, to doctrine ; for in

doinq this thou shall save both tleyself, and them that hear

thee. These are the men whom he wishes to be honoured most

of all, and he adds the reason, for they sustain great labour.
