2 ΤΙΜ. iii. 16, 17.

Au Scriptura> is qiven by inspiration of God, (md is profitable
for doctrine‚for repo·o‹ff,jbr correction, for instruction in
riyhteousness: T 1ιαί the man Qf G'od may be perfect,
throuthyfurnished unio all qood works.

HAVING offered much exhortation and consolation from
other sourceS, he adds that which is more perfect, derived
from the Scriptures3 and he is reasonably full in offering
consolation, because he has a great and sad thing to say.
For if Elisha, who was with his master to his last breath,
when he saw him departing as it were in death ³, rent his
garments for grief, what think you must this disciple suffer,
so loving and so beloved, upon hearing that his master was
about to die, and that he could not enjoy his company when
he was near his death, which is above all things apt to be
distressing ? For we are less grateful for the past time, when
we have been deprived of the more recent intercourse of
those who are departed. For this reason when he had
previously offered much consolation, he then discourses
concerning his own death: and this in no ordinary way: but
in words adapted to comfort him and fill him with joy3 so
as to have it considered as a sacrifice rather than'a death3 a
migration‚ as in fact it waS, and a removal to a better state.

²¹ ὃν ‹go'aeu φιλικῆς ἱρᾶἱν αὐτὸν φιλω- and strange manner of death.’ 'I'he
«ὅκα. Au old Lat. has ⁴ by a new present Greek is difficult and suspected.
