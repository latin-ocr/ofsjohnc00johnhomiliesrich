2 Tm. If it were for our good, God would not have grudged us
3'¹3'15‘this foreknowledge. He who has revealed to us things in
heaven, would not have envied us, For, All thinys, He sayS‚
that Ι have heard of the Father J have made known anto
John15,you ; and, I call you- not servante, but friends. Ye are my
¹⁵· friends⁸ Why then did He not make these things known
unto us? Because He would not have us concerned about
them. And as a proof that He does not envy us this know-
ledge, such things were revealed to the ancientS, because
they were babeS, even about an ass¹, and the like. But to uS,
because He would not have us concerned about such thingS,
He has not cared to reveal them. But what do we leam?
Things which they never knew, for little indeed were all
those things of old. But what we are taught is this, that we
shall rise again, that we shall be immortal, and incorruptible,
that our life shall have no end, that all things will pass away, ³
that we shall be caught up in the cloudS, that the wicked
shall suffer punishment, and numberless other things,
and in all these there is no salsehood. Is it not better to
know these than to hear that the ass that was lost is found?
Lo, thou hast gotten thine ass! Lo, thou hast found him!
What is thy gain ? Will he not soon be lost again some other
way? For if be leave thee not, at least thou wilt lose him in
thy death. But the things which I have mentioned, if we
will but hold them fast, we shall retain perpetually. These
therefore let us pursue. To these stable and enduring goods
let us attach ourselves. Let us not give heed to soothsayers,
fortune-tellers, and jugglerS, but to God who knoweth all
things certainly, whose knowledge is universal. . Thus we
shall know all that it befits us to knOW, and shall obtain all
good things, through the grace and lovingkindneSS‚ διο.
