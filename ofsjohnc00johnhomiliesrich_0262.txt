236 Job afflieted, yet his alms rewarded.

3' 1'7' charge, and applying a plaister, it will suffer the like disease
of its own3 so she who will not minister to another when she l
is not herself affiicted, will have to bear sufferings of her own.
For the evil spreading from the other part will reach to this
also, and the question will not be of ministering to the other,
but of its own cure and relief. So it is here alsa He that
will not relieve others, will be a sufferer himself. T Ιιοιι has-t
lcedyed him in, saith Satan, within and without, and I dare
not attack him! But he suffered afflictionS, you say. True.
But those afflictions were the occasion of great good. His
substance was doubled, his reward increased, his righteous-
ness enlarged, his crown was splendid, his prize glorious,
Both his spiritual and temporal blessings were augmented.
He lost his children, but he received, not these restored, but
others in their room, and those too he had safe for the Re-
surrection. Had they been restored, the number would have χ
been diminished, but now having given others in their stead, ³
He will present them also at the Resurrection. All these
things happened to him, because of his openhandedness in
almsgiving. Let us then do likewise, that we may obtain the
same rewards by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Amen.
