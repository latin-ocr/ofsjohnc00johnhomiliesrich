wealth to corrupt the judge. For the faculty of judging is Hom.
ζ naturally implanted in us by God, and what comes from God V.
cannot be so corrupted. But uneasy slumbers, thick-coming (4)
. fancies, and the frequent recollections of guilt, destroy our
, repose. Has any one, for instance, unjustly deprived another
of his house? not only is he that is robbed rendered unhappy,
ν but the man who robbed him. If 116 is persuaded of a future
ξ judgment, (if indeed any one is so persuaded,) he groans ex-
ceedingly, and is in misery. But if he believes not in futurity,
ξ yet he blushes for shame3 or rather there is no man, whether
Greek, Jew, or heretic, who is not afraid of a judgment to

his imagination dwells, and he lives in continual sear.

Know you not what the unrighteous suffer? Is there no
bitterness in these things? And were there nothing of this

themselves, much more do they condemn another, calling
him rapacious, fraudulent, a pestilent fellow. What pleasure
then can 116 enjoy? He has only the heavier care and anxiety
to preserve his gains, and the being more anxious and
troubled. For the more wealth any one gets about him, the
more painful watchfulness does he store up for himself. Then
what are the curses of those whom he has wronged, their
pleadings against him1? And what, if sickness should nra-0751„

sickness, however atheistically he may be inclined, not to be
anxious about these things, not to be thoughtful, when
he is unable to do any thing. For as long as we are
