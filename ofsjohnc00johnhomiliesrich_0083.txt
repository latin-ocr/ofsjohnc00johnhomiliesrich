The truth: what truth? Faith in Him. And indeed he had
previously said, Charye some that they teat-h πο otlzer doc-
trine. But that no one may consider such as enemieS, and

He will leave all men to be saved, and to come to tlze

Ι knowledye of tlze παθη and having said this, he adds,

Ver. 5. For there is one God, and one Mediator between

³ God and men.

He had before said, to come to tlze knowledye (ff tlze trulla,

implying that the world is not in the truth. Now he sayS,
ἱ that there is one God, that is, not as some say, many, and that
² He has sent His Son as Mediator, thus giving proof that He
will have all men to be saved. But is not the Son God?
Most truly He is, why then does he say, One God,? In con-
tradistinction to the idols3 not to the Son. For he is dis-
4- coursin g about truth and error. Now a mediator ought to have

communion with both partieS, between whom he is to mediate.

ἶ For this is the property of a mediator, to be in close com-
. munion with each of those whose mediator he is· For he

would be no longer a mediator, if he were connected with‘

3 one but separated from the othere. If therefore He partakes
not of the nature os the Father, He is not a Mediator, but is
separated. For as He is partaker of the nature of men, be-
* cause He came to men, so is He partaker of the nature of
i God, beoause He came from God. Because He was to me-

diate between two natureS‚ He must approximate to the two

natures3 for as the place situated between two others is joined
³ to each place, so must that between natures be joined to
’ either nature. As therefore He became Man, so was He

also God, A man could not have become a mediator, be-
