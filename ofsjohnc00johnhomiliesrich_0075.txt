neighbours, not only 101 1116 faithful, but for the unbelieving

What? Has He commanded you to pray for your enemieS‚
and do you pray against your brother? But your prayer is
not against him, but against yourself. For you provoke God'
by uttering those impious words, ‘ Shew him the same 1' ‘ So
do to him l' ‘ Smite him !’ ‘ Recompense him !’ Far be such
words from the disciple of Christ, who should be meek and
mild. From the mouth that has been vouchsafed such holy
Mysteries, let nothing bitter proceed ¹. Let not the tongue¹ See

injuriousness and prayer are at variance with each other,
cursing and praying are far apart, accusation and prayer are
wide asunder. Do you propitiate God with prayer, and
then utter imprecations? If you forgive not, you will not be Matt. 6,

how shall he be forgiven? The harm is to yourself, not him.
For though your prayers were on the point 01 being heard
for yourself, they would never be accepted in such a case, as
offered with a polluted mouth. For surely the mouth that
curses is polluted with all that is offensive and unclean.

When you ought to tremble 101 your own 81118, 10 1117168116
