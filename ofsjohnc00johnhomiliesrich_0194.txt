he may not, as if he had been forgetful, have the character
of one void of friendship and conscience, he justly praises
himself, saying, that without ceasiny I have remembrance of
thee, and not simply that, but in my prayer-s. That is, it is

urged me to come to thee. So then he wept. And he
mentions another cause, and that of a consolatory kind.

GentileS, nor of unbelieverS, but of a family that served

Acts 16, Christ from the first.
