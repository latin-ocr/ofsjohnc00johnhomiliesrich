1 Tm. And bffore Jesus Christ, Who before Pontius Pilato wit-
6'13‘1-‘3‘nessed a 90οά confession.
The exhortation again is derived from the example of his
Master, and whathe means is this3 as He had done, so ought
sslPet· 2, ye to do, for for this cause He witnessed, that we might

A 90οά confession ¹¹¹. What he does in his Epistle to the χ

the cross‚ despisiny the shmne, and is set down attho riqht ¹
hand of the throne os aod. For consider Him that endured ’
such contradiction of sinners ayainst Himseff, lest yc be wea-
