lCor. 7, If then lze who is married caressor tloe thinys of tlte world,
33' and a bishop ought not to care for the things of the world,
why does he say the husband of one wife? Some indeed
think that he says this with reference to one who remains
1 Cor. 7, free⁰ from a wife. But if otherwise, he that hath a wife may
29. be as though he had none. For that liberty was then pro-
perly granted, as suited to the nature of the circumstances
then existing. And it is very possible, if a man will, so to
regulate his conduct. For as riches make it difficult to enter
into the kingdom of Heaven‚ yet rich men have often entered
in, so it is with marriage. But why does he say, speaking of
a Bishpp, that he should be not yiven to wine, lcospitable,
when he should name greater things? Why said he not
that he should be an Angel, not subject to human passions?
Where are those great qualities of which Christ speakS, which
even those under their rule ought to possess? To be cru-
cified to the world, to be always ready to lay down their

wine, he says; a good prospect indeed, if such are the things
of which a Bishop is to be admonished! Why has he not said
that he ought to be already raised above the world? But
dost thou demand less of the Bishop, than even of those in the
coloss, world? For to these he saith, Mortisy your member-3 which are
