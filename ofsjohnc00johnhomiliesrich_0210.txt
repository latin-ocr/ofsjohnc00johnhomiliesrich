By no means. Every thing worketh according to thy saith.
Not even the righteous man can benefit thee, if thou art
unfaithful‚ nor the unrighteous barm thee, if thou art faith-
sul. God, when He would save His people‚ wrought for the
ark by Oxenp. Is it the good life or the virtue of the Priest
that confers so much on thee? The gifts which God bestows
are not such as to be effects of the virtue of the Priest. All

 

is of grace. His part is but to open his mouth, while God ἒ

worketh all: the Priest only performs a symbolq. Consider
how wide was the distance between John and J esus. Hear
Matt.3‚John saying, I bave need to be baptized of leee, and, Wkose

{iim 1 standing this difference‚ the Spirit descended. Which John

Yet nevertheleSS, It descended not till He was baptized. But

neither was it John who caused It to descend. Why then is

this done? That thou mayest learn that the Priest performs

a symbol'. No man differs so widely from another man, as
’ὅξάὖ- John from Jesus, and yet with him1 the Spirit descended,
' that we may leam, that it is God who worketh all, that all is
God’s doing. I am about to say what may appear strange,
but be not astonished nor startled at it. The Offering is the
same, whether a common man, or Paul or Peter offer it. 'It is
the same which Christ gave to His discipleS, and which the
Priests now minister. This is no vvise inferior to that, be-
cause it is not men that sanctify even this, but the Same who
sanctified the one sanctifies the other also. For as the words
which God spake are the same which the Priest now utters,
so is the Offering the same, and the Baptism‚ that which He
gave. Thus the whole is of saith. The Spirit immediately

fell upon Cornelius, because he had previously fulfilled his
