Heathen testimonies ayainst Heatlcem'sm. 293

, If then this testimony is true, observe what a difficulty! Hom.
3 For if the poet is true who said that they spoke falsely, in HI·
1 asserting that Jupiter could die, as the Apostle says, it is a fear-
* ful thing ! Attend, beloved, with much exactness. The poet
said that the Cretans were liars for saying that Jupiter was dead.
The Apostle confirmed his testimony: s0, according to the
Α Apostle, Jupiter is imm'ortal: for he sayS, this witness is true J
⁷ What shall we say then? Or rather how shall we solve this?
a The Apostle has not said this, but simply and plainly ap-

they did not receive all their gods from the beginning, but
from time to time admitted some otherS, as those from the
HyperboreanS, the worship of Pan, and the greater and
the lesser.mysteries, so these same, conjecturing that besides
these there might be some other God, of whom they were
ignorant, that they might be duly devout to him aISO,
erected to him an altar, with this inscription, To tlte Un-
known God, thereby almost implying, ‘if there might be
some God unknown to them? He therefore said to them,
Him whom you have by anticipation acknowledged, I de-
clare to you. But those words, We also are His offleprinq,
are quoted from AratUS, who having previously said, ‘ Earth's
