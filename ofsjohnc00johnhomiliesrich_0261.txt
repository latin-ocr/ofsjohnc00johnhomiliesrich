ligently followed every qood work. But when after the death V11.
5 of thy husband, thou art arrayed in the same pomp of wealth,
’τ no wonder if thou canst not support widowhood. Transfer
'21:ss this wealth‚ therefore, to heaven, and thou wilt find the bur-
f den of widowhood tolerable. But, thou sayest, what if I have
ἓ· children to succeed to their father’s inheritance? Instruct
them also to despise riches. Transfer thy own possessions,
7 reserving for them just a suffic-iency. Teach them too to be
  superior to riches. But what if besides my silver and gold,
h? Ι am surrounded by a crowd of slaves, oppressed by a multi-
5‘ss tude of affairS, how shall I be equal to the care of all these
’ things, when deprived of the support of my husband? This is
2 but an excuse, a pretence, as appears from many causes For
if thou dost not deserve wealth, nor seek to increase thy pre-
η, sent possessions, thy burden will be light. To get riches is
·- much more laborious than ‚to take care of them. If therefore
thou cuttest off this one thing, accumulating, and suppliest
the needy out of thy substance, God will hold over thee His
protecting hand. And if thou sayest this from a real desire
to preserve the inheritance of thy fatherless children, and art
” not, under this pretence, possessed with covetousness3 He
who searches the heart knows how to secure their richeS,
even He who commanded thee to bring up children.
