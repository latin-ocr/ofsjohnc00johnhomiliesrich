sall l mean, over a long sea, and not feel disquietude, so it is Hom
Γ not possible to pass through this life, without experience of
²² sorrow, yea though you name a rich man3 for in that he 18
’ξ rich, he hath many occasions of inordinate desiresd, yea,
though the king himself, since he too is ruled by many, and
cannot do all that he would. Many favours he grants con-
, trary to his wisheS, and more than all men is obliged to do
what he would not. How so? Because he has many about

him who wish to receive his gifts. And just think howe

great is his chagrin, when he is desirous to effect something,

but is unable, either from sear or suspicion, or hindered by

enemies or by friends. Often when he has succeeded in

achieving some end, he loses all the pleasure of it, from
many becoming at enmity with him. Again, do you think
>that they ,are free from grief, who live a life of ease? It is
„ impossible. As a man cannot escape death, so neither can
,. 116 escape sorrow. How many troubles must they endure,
ῗ which we cannot express in wordS, and which they only can

know by experience! How many have prayed a thousand
’ times to die, in the midst of their wealth and luxury! For

ἠ rather the very thing to produce sorrOWS, diseaseS, and unea-

such is the habit of the soul, it is apt to grieve even without

mach arise sorrows c without any occasion ; and does not the
ἶ like happen to ourselveS, to feel uneasy, without knowing any
cause for it ? In short, we can find no one who is exempted
ζ from sorrow. And if he has less occasion for grief than our-
selves, yet he thinks otherwise, for he feels his own sorrows,
more than those of other men. As they who suffer pain in any
part of their bodieS, think that their sufferings exceed their
neighbour’s. He that has a disease of the eye, thinks there
ἰἶ 18 nothing so painful, and he that has a disorder in the
stomach, considers that the sorest of diseaseS, and each thinks
*⁶ that the heaviest of sufferings, with which he is himself
3 afflicted. So it is with sorrOW, each thinks his own present

grief the most severe. For of this he judges by his own ex-
