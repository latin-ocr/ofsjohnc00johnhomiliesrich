THERE are some failings which age haS, that youth has

' not. Some indeed it has in common with youth, but in addi-
ᾗ» tion it has* a slowness, a timidity, a forgetfulness, an insensi-
'·'‘ bility, and an irritability. For this reason he exhorts old

men concerning these matterS, to be viqilantb. For there

ᾗ are many things which at this period make men otherwise
. than vigilant, especially what I mentioned, their general

Ῑ insensibility, and the difficulty of stirring or exciting them.

Wherefore he also adds, ssave, temperate. Here he means
prudent. For temperance is named from the well-tempered eosve·-

’ mind. For there are, indeed there are, among the old, some ‘'m’'
’ who rave and are beside themselveS, some from wine, and

some from sorrow. For old age makes them narrowminded.
Sound infmffi, in cbarity, in patience.
He haswell added in patience, for this quality more espe-
cially befits old men.

many faults, old age however has.
