sons by name, that he might not, by the openness of 1118
rebuke, render them more shameless. There were in that
city certain false Apostles of the J eWS, who wished to oblige
the faithful to observe the Jewish law, a fault he is every
where noticing in his Epistles3 and this they did not from

, motives· of conscience, so much as from vainglory, and a

wish to have discipleS, from jealousy of the blessed Paul, and

a spirit of opposition to him. This is meant by teacleiny

another doctrine.

them endless? It is because they had no end, or none of
any use, or none easy for us to apprehend. Mark how he
disapproves of questioning. For where saith existS, there

is no need of question. Where there 1s no room for curiosity,
questions are superfluouS. Questioning is the subversion of

questions cannot believe. Therefore it is his advice that we
should not be occupied with questions, since if we question,

it 18 1101 saith, for saith sets reasoning at rest. But why then
