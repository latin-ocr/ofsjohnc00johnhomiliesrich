Gal. 6, the boast of Paul, God forbid that I should ρίαν-ιχ, save in the 1

²⁴· Crosa of our Lord Jesus Christ. But natural men, and those ἶ

 

who attribute to God no more than to human bein gS, stum-hle, ,
and become ashamed. Wherefore Paul from the first exhorts i
his disciple, and through him all others, in these words: Be j
not thou ashamed of the testimony qs our Lord, that is ⁰,
“ Be not ashamed, that thou preachest One that was crucified,
but rather glory in it.’‘ For in themselves death and im-
prisonment and chains are matters of shame and reproach.
But when the cause is added before us, and the mystery
viewed aright, they will appear full of dignity, and matter
for boasting.. For it was that death which saved the world,
when it was perishing. That death connected earth with
heaven, that death destroyed the power of the devss, and
made men angeIS, and sons of God: that death raised our
nature to the kingly throne. Those chains were the con-
version of many. Be not therefore ashamed, he sayS, of tlte
testimony of om Lord, nor of me His prisoner: but be thou
pao-talem· of tlte afflictions of the Gospel5 that is, though
thou shouldest suffer the same things, be not thou ashamed. j
For that this is implied appears from what he said above3
God laath yiven us a spirit qf power, and of love, (md qf a
sound mind ; and by what follows, Be thou partalcer of the
sufferinys of tlte Gospel: not merely be not ashamed of
them, but be not ashamed even to experience them.

And he does not say, ‘ Do not fear,' but, the more to en-
courage him, ‘ be not ashamed,' as if there were no further
danger, if he could overcome the shame. For shame is only
then oppressive, when one is overcome by it. Be not therefore
ashamed, if I, who raised the dead, who wrought miracleS,
who traversed the world, am now 3 prisoner. For Ι 3111
