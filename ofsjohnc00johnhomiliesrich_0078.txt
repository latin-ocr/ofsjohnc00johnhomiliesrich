52 ’ God’s forbearance om· example.

121³}- God is daily blasphemed and mocked by believers and un-

 

, believerS, both in word and in deed? What then? Has He
for this extinguished the sun? or stayed the course of the
moon? Has He crushed the heavens and uproo'ted the earth?
Has He dried up the sea? Has He shut up the fountains of
waters? or confounded the air? Nay, on the contrary, He
makes His sun to rise, His rain to descend, gives the fruits of

. the earth in their seasons, and thus supplies yearly nourish-
ment to the blasphemers, to the insensible, to the polluted, to
persecutors 3 not for one day or two, but for their whole lise.
Imitate Him then, emulate Him as far as human powers
admit. Canst thou not make the sun arise? Abstain from

’ evil speaking. Canst thou not send rain? Forbear reviling.
Canst thou not give food? Refrain from insolence. Such gifts
from thee are sufficient. The goodness of God to His eness
mies is shewn by His works. Do thou so at least by wordsi
pray for thine enemieS, so wilt thou be like thy Father which
is in heaven. How many times have we discoursed upon
this subject! nor shall we cease to discourse3 only let some-
thing come of it. It is not that we are drowsy, and weary of
speaking;·only do not you that hear be annoyed. Now a
person seems to be annoyed, when he will not do what one
says. For he who practiseS‚ loves often to hear the same
thing, and is not annoyed by it; for it is his own commend-
ation. But annoyance arises simply from not doing what
is prescribed. Hence the speaker is troublesome. If a
man practises almsgiving, and hears another speak of alms-
giving, he is not weariedd, but pleased‚ for he hears his own
good actions recommended and proclaimed. So that when
we are displeased at hearing a discourse upon the forgiveness
of injuries‚ it is because we have no interest in forbearance,
it is not practised by us; for if we had the reality, we should
not be pained at its being named. If therefore you would not
have us wearisome or annoying, practise as we preach, exhibit
in your actions the subjectos our discourseS. For we shall
never cease discoursing upon these things till your conduct
is agreeable to them. And this we do inore especially from
our concern and affection for you. For the trumpeter must
sound his trumpet‚ though no one should go out to war3 he

d ἀποκναίει. Dounaeus conjectures ἀπηνεῖ. The other is usually transitive.
