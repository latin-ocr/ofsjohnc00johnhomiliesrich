· nothing of the channels of the heated and obstructed blood,

of those reservoirS, the liver and the spleen, and of the canals

by which the faeces are discharged. The drains in our streets
Ῑί we take care to keep unobstructed. We cleanse our sewers
with poles and dragS, that they may not be stopped, or overflow,
³ but the canals of our bodies we do not keep clear, but obstruet

and choke them up, and when the filth rises to the very throne
of the king, Ι mean the brain, we do not regard it, treating
it not like a worthy king, but like an unclean brute. God
hath purpose] y removed to 3 distance those unclean memberS,
that we might not receive offence from them. But we suffer
it not to be s0, and spoil all by our excess. And other evils
might be mentioned. To obstruet the sewers is to breed a
pestilence: but if a stench from without is pestilential, that
which is pgnt up within the body, and cannot find a vent,
what disorders must it not produce both to body and soul?
Some have strangely complained, wondering why God has
ordained that We should bear a load of ordure with us. But
they themselves increase the load. God designed thus to
detach us from luxury, and to persuade us not to attach our-
selves to worldly things. But thou art not thus to be per-
suaded to cease from gluttony, but though it is but as far as
the throat, and as long as the hour of eating, nay not even so
long, that the pleasure abideS, thou continuest in thine indul-
gence. Is it not true that as soon as it has passed the palate
and the throat, the pleasure ceases? For the sense of it is in
the taste, and after that is gratified‚ a nausea succeedS, the
stomach not digesting the food, or not without much difficulty.
J ustly then is it said, that she tlzat livetlc in pleasure is dead

or to see any thing. It becomes weak, ignoble, unmanly,

Ἰ illiberal, cowardly, full of impudence‚ servility, igno-

rance, rage, violence, and all kinds of evil, and destitute of
