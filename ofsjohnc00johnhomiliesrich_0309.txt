order. But those things which were rather attended with

y* honour and praise he committed to his disciple, as the
{ordination of Bishops, and such other things as required
some farther arrangement ¹, or, so to speak, to be brought to¹ ²⁹5¹&-
'qs-greater perfection. What sayest thou? does he farther set⁰⁶⁹m⁸⁶⁹⁶⁸
ἐξίῃ order thy work? and dost thou not think it a disgrace
{abringing shame upon thee? By no means; for I look only

to the common good, and whether it be done by me, or by
another, it makes no difference to me. Thus it becomes

4 him to be affected who presides in the Church, not to seek

’ his own honour, but the common good.

And ordain elder-s· in every city, here he is speaking of

 

Bishops, as we have before said ²¹, as Ι had appointed thee.
u‚fssIfany is blameless. In every city, he sayS, for he did not
wish the whole island to be intrusted to one, but that each
should have his own charge and care, for thus he would have
less labour himself, and those under his rule would receive
greater attention, if the Teacher had not to go about tob
the presidency of many ChurcheS, but was left to be occu-
pied with one only, and to bring that into order.
Ver. 6. If any he blamelew, the husband of one wife,
baviny faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.
Why does he bring forward such an one? To stop the
ᾖ mouths of those heretics, who condemned marriage, shewing
that it is not an unholy thing in itself, but so far honourable,
ἶ that a married man might ascend the holy throne; and at
the same reproving the wauton, and not permitting their ad·-
mission into this high office who contracted a second marriage.
For he who retains no kind regard sor her who is departed,
how shall he be a good president? and what accusation would
he not incur? For you all know, that though it is not for-
bidden by the laws to enter into a second marriage, yet it is
a thing liable to many ill constructions. Wishing there-
fore a ruler to give no handle for reproach to those under

his rule, he on this account sayS, [f any be blameless ², that2 ἀνεγ-
