I will now cite you from the Scriptures a wonderful instance
of friendship. Jonathan, the son of Saul, loved David, and

he envy David? Not at all, though he had great reason.
How? Because, by the events he perceived that the king-
dom would pass from himself to him, yet he felt nothing of
the kind. He did not say, ‘ This is he that is depriving me
of my paterna] kingdom,' but he favoured his obtaining the
sovereignty3 and he spared not his father for the sake of his
- friend. ’ Yet let not any one think him'a parricide, for he did
not. injure his father, but restrained his unjust attempts. He
rather spared than injured him. He did not permit him to
proceed to an unjust murder. He was many times willing even
to die for his friend, and far from accusing him, he restrained
even his father's accusation. Instead of envying, he joined
in obtaining the kingdom for him. Why do Ι speak of wealth?
He even sacrificed his own life for him. For the sake
of his friend, he did not even stand in awe of his father, since
his fatherentertained unjust designs, but his conscience was
free from all such. Thus justice was conjoined with friend-
ship.

Such then was J onathan. Let us now consider David. He
had no opportunity of returning the recompense, for his be-
nefactor was taken away before the reign of David, and slain
before he whom he had served came to his kingdom. What
then? As far as it was allowed him and left in his power, let
us see how that righteous man manifested his friendship.
