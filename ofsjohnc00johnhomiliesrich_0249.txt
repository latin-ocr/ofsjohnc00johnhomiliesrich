or of rapine, that produces mercy. Do not put a slander on
almsgiving. Do not cause it to be evil spoken of by all. If
thou committest robbery for this, that thou mayest give almS,
nothing is more wicked than thy almsgiving. For when it is
produced by rapine, it is not almsgiving, it is inhumanity, it
is cruelty, it is an insult to God. If Cain so offended, by
offeriug inferior gifts of his own, shall he not offend‚ who
offers the goods of another? An offering is nothing else but
a sacrifice, a purification‚ not a pollution. And thou who
darest not to pray with unclean hands, dost thou offer the
dirt and filth of robbery, and think thou doest nothing wrong?
Thou sufferest not thy hands to be full of dirt and filth, but
having first cleansed these, thou offerest. Yet that filth is
no charge against thee, while the other deserves reproach and
blame. Let it not therefore be our consideration, how we
may offer prayers and oblationsi with clean handS, but how
the things offered may be pure. If one, after having washed a
vessel clean, should fill it with uncleau gistS, would it not be
ridiculous mockery? Let the hands be clean; and they will
ᾖ be so, if ‚we wash them not with water only, but first with
righteousness. This is the purifier of the hands. But if they
be full of unrighteousness‚ though they be washed a thousand

No; but what? Put away tlte evil of your doinyssrom your
souls. This is to be clean ¹‘. This it is to be cleansed from
· defilement. This is real purity. The other is of little use;
but this bestows upon us confidence towards God. The one
may be obtained by adultererS, thieveS, murdererS, by worth-
leSS, and dissolute, and effeminate persons, and especially the
latter. For they are ever careful of the cleanliness of their

bodieS, and scented with persumeS‚ cleansing their sepulchre¹.¹051p‹.oe.
For their body² is but a sepulchre, since the soul is deadnfgm,

within it. This cleanness therefore may be theirs ¹, but not
that which is inward.
