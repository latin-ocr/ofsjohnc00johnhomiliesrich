but those who had learnt this, yet afterwards turned aside,
they delivered to Satan3 shewing that they were sustained
not by their own power, but by their care for them3 and as
many as were lifted up into arrogance were delivered to him.
For as kings with their own hands slay their enemies, but de-
liver their subjects to executioners for punishment, so it is in
this case. And these acts were done to shew the authority
committed to the Apostles. Nor was it a slight power, to be
able thus to subject the devil to their commandS. For this
shews that he served and obeyed them even against his will,
and this was no little proof of the power of grace. And listen
how he delivered them: When με are yatkered toyethem and
my spirit, with tlze power of om· Lord Jesus Christ, to de-
liver such cm one mtto Satan. He was then immediately ex-
pelled from the common assembly, he was separated from the
sold, he became deserted and destitute, he was delivered to
the wolf. For as the cloud designated the camp of the
HebreWS, so the Spirit distinguished the Church. If any
one therefore was without, he was consumede, and it was by
the judgment of the Apostles that he was cast out of the pale.
So also the Lord delivered J udas to Satan. For immediately
after tlte sop Satan entered into kim. Or this may be said, that
those whom they wished to amend, they did not themselves

punish, but reserved their punishments for those who were

incorrigible. Or otherwise, that they were the more dreaded
for delivering them up to otherS. J ob also was delivered to
Satan, but not for his sinS, but for fuller proof of his
worth.

Many such instances still occur. For since the Priests
cannot know who are sinners, and unworthy partakers of the
holy MysterieS, God often in this way delivers them to Satan.
For when diseaseS, and attacksf, and sormws, and calamitieS,
and the like occur, it is on this account that they are inflicted.
This is shewn by Paul. For this cause many are wealc and
sickly amony you, ancl many sleep. But how? saith one,
when We approach but once a year! But this is indeed the
evil, that you determine the worthiness of your approach, not
