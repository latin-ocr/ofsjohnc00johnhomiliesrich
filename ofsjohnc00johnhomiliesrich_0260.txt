‘234 Lovesbr the Departed. Christian Widowlcood.

no slight tribute, but he also frequently rescued from danger
his son and his grandson, in remembrance of the kindness
of the father, and he continued to support and protect his
children, as he would have done those of his own son. Such
friendship I would wish all to entertain both towards the
living and the dead.

Let women listen to this (for it is on their account espe-
cially that I refer to the departed) who enter into a second
marriage, and defile the bed of their deceased husband,
though they have loved himf. Not that I forbid a second
marriage, or pronounce it a proof of wantonneSS, for Paul
does not allow me, stopping my mouth by saying to women,
ffslze marry she bath not sinned. Yet let us attend to Q
what follows, But she is happier {f slce so abide. This ÷
state is much better than the other. Wherefore? for many
reasonS. For if it is better not to marry at all than to marry,
much more in this case. ‘ But some, you say, could not en-
dure widowhood, and have fallen into many misfortunes.’
Yes 3 because they know not what widowhood is. For it is
not widowhood to be exempt from a second marriage, as
neither is it virginity to be altogether unmarried. For as
that which is comely, ⁴and that ye may attend upon tlte Lord
without distraho-tion, is the mark of the one state, so it is the
mark of the other to be desolate, to continue in supplicatione
awdprayerS, to renounce luxury and pleasure. For she that
livetlz in pleasure is dead whilst she livelh. If remaining a
widow, thou wouldest have the same pomp, the same show,
the same attite, as thou hadst while thy husband was living,
it were better for thee to marry. For it is not the union that
is objectionable, but the multitude of cares that attend it.
But that which is not wrong, thou dost not: but that which
is not indifferent, which is liable to blame, in that thou
involvest thyself. On this account some leave turned asido
after Satan, because they have not been able to live properly
as widows.

Wouldcst thou know what a widow is, and what a widow’s
diguity, hear Paul's account of it. Is 8]oe leave brozcylct up
children, is she have lodyed stranyerS, is She have wasked the

f Sav. mar· ζ having eeased to love him.’
