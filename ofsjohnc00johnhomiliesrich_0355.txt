—But these difficulties were of his own seeking. For we are

not commanded to become rich, but the reverse. But he
prepares for himself so many stumbling-blocks and impedi-
ments.

Others not only divest themselves of riches, but macerate

their bodieS, as travellers in the narrow way. Instead of
doing this, thou heatest more intensely the furnace of thy
passionS, and gettest more about thee⁵. Go therefore into
the broad way, for it is that which receives such as thee.
But the narrow way is for those who are affiicted and strait—
ened, who bear along with them nothing but those burdenS‚
which they can carry through it, as almsgiving, love for man-
kind, good'ness, and meekneSS. These if thou bearest, thou
wfft easily find entrance, but if thou takest with thee arrogance,
a soul inflamed with passionS, and that load of thomS, wealth,
there is need of wide room for thee to paSS, nor wilt thou well
be able to enter into the crowd without striking others, and
coming down upon them on thy way. In this case a wide
, distance from others is required. But he who carries gold
and silver, I mean the aohievements of virtue, does not cause
η his neighbours to fiee from him, but brings men nearer to
him, even to link themselves with himk. But if riches in
themselves are thornS, what must covetousness be? Why
dost thou take that away with thee ? Is it to make the flame
greater by adding fuel to that fire? Is not the fire of hell
sufficient? Consider how the Three Children overcame the
furnace. Imagine that to be hell. With tribulation were
they plun-ged into it, bound and fettered; but within they
found large room ; not so they that stood around without.

Something of this kind even now will be experienced‚ if
we will mansully resist the trials that encompass us, If we
have hope in God, we shall be in security, and have ample
room, and those who bring us into these straits shall perish. “
