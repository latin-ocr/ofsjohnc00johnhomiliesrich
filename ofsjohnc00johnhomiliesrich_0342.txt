Unto Greeks and JeWS‚ to the wicked and the evil. For
when he says, Let kim that standeth, take lzeed lest ke sall,
he wakens their fears from the future3 but here, on the*
contrary, he exhorts them from the consideration of the past„
and the same in what follows ;

Ver. 3. For we ourselves also were sometimessoolz'sk.

Thus also he does in his Epistle to the GalatianS, where2

Ga1.4‚3. he says, Even 80 we, when we were children, were in bondaye
under the elements of the world. Therefore he sayS, Re-
vile no one, for such also thou wast thyself. ’

For we ourselves also were sometimes foolisk‚ disobedient,
deceivecl‚ serviny divers lusts and pleasure3‚ livinq in maliee
and enm, hate-ful, and hatiny one another.

Therefore we ought to be thus to all, to be gently disposed.
For 116 who was formerly in such a state, and has been
delivered from it, ought not to reproach others, but to pray‚
to be thankful to Him who has granted both to him and
them deliverance from such evils. Let no one boast3 for
all have sinned. If then, doing well thyself‚ thou art inclined
to revile others, consider thy own former life, and the uncer-
tainty of the future, and restrain thy anger ⁸. For if thou
hast lived virtuously from thy earliest youth, yet nevertheless
thou mayest have many sins3 and if thou hast not, as thou
thinkest, consider that this is not the effect of thy virtue, but
of the grace of God. For if He had not called thy fore-
fathers, thou wouldest have been disobedient. See here how
he mentions every sort of wickedness. How many things
has not God dispensed by the Prophets and all other means?
have we heard?

For we, he says, were once deceived.

Ver. 4. But qfter that the kindness and love of God om·
Saviour toward man appeared. How? Not by works qs
riqleteousness which we have done, but according] to His
merey He saved us, by the verashiny of reyeneration, and
renewiny qftlce Holy Ghost.

q''‘''¹‘⁷““¹'‘’¹we could not be purified, but needed a new birth? For this

g colb. and Old Lat. impulse.
