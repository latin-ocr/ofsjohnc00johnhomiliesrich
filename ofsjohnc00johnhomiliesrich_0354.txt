the time of the ApostleS, men selling their possessions brought
them to them, and they were distributed. For it is said,
Distribution was made ‘emto every man accordiny as he had
need. For tell me nOW, setting aside the future, and not now
considering the kingdom that is to come, let us see who in
the present life are the gainers, those who received, or those
who gave. The former murmured and quarrelled with each
other. The latter had one soul. Ueey were osone beart,
and osone soal, it is said, and ‚qrace was upon them all.
And they lived in great simplicity ¹¹. Dost thou see that
they were gainers even by thus giving? Tell me nOW, with ,
whom would you wish to be numbered, with those who gave
away their possessionS, and had nothing, or with those who
received even the goods of others? ἢ

See the fruit of almsgiving, the separatioris and hindranees
were removed, and immediately their souls weretknit tog'ssther.

with gain. And these things Ι have said, that those who have
not succeeded to an inheritance from their forefathers may
not be cast down, as if they had less than those who are
wealthy. For if they please they have more. For they will
more readily incline to almsgiving, like the widow‚ and they
will have no occasion for enmity towards their neighbour, and
they will enjoy freedom in every respect. Such an one can
not be threatened with the confiscation of his goodS, and he
is superior to all wrongs. As those who fly unincumbered
with clothes are not easily caught, but they who are incum-
bered with many garments and a long train are soon overtaken,
so it is with the rich man and the poor. The one, though he
be taken, will easily make his escape, whilst the other, though
he be not detained, is incumbered by cords of his own, by
numberless cares, distresseS, passions‚ provocationS, all which
over-whelm the soul, and not these alone, but many other
things which riches draw after them. It is much more
difficult for a rich man to be moderate and to live frugally,
than for the poor, more difficult for him to be sree from pas-
