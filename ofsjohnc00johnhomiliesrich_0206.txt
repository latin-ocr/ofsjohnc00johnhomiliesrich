180 The Priest’s Office to be honoured sor God’s sake.

2 Τηι. will not be benefited by the honour done them, but receive
1, ¹²· the greater condemnation, neither will they be injured as to
the future by ill treatment, but will have the more excuse. ²

But all this I desire to be done sor your own sakes. For {s

when rulers are honoured by their people‚ this too is reckoned

1 Sam. against them, as in the case of Eli it is said, Did I not choose
² · him out of his fatlzer’ s house? But when they are insulted, 'l

 

as in the instance of Samuel, God said, They leave not rejected ¹.
8, 7. ⁵ thee, but they have rejected Me. Therefore insult is their ³⁴
gain, honour their burden. What Ι say, therefore,' is for your
sakes, not for theirs. He that honours the Priest, will honour ¹
God also3 and he who has learnt to despise the Priest, will
Matt. in process of time insult God. He that receivetk you, He
Ec'elus'. saith, receivetlz Me. Hola' my priests in honour, He says,
7² 31 Ρ The Jews learned to despise God, because they despised
MoseS, and would have stoned him. For when a man is
piously disposed towards the Priest, he is much more so
towards God. And even if the Priest be wicked, God seeing
that thou respectest him, though unworthy of honour, through ζ
Matt. reverence to Him, will Himself reward thee. For if he that
ω’ ‘²¹' receivetlz a prophet in tlte name of a prophet shall receive a
prophet’s reward ; then he who honoureth and submitteth
and giveth way to the Priest shall certainly be rewarded.
For if in the case of hospitality, when, thou knowest not the ⁴
guest, thou receivest so high a recompense, much more wilt
thou be requited, if thou obeyest him whom He requires thee
Matt. to obey. T Ιιθ Ser-ibes aud Pharis-em, He sayS, sitin Moses'
²3⁷ 2 3 seat& all therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe‚ that οό-
serve and de, but do not ye after llzeir works. Knowest thou
¹01· a not what the Priest 1s Ρ He is an Angel¹ of the Lord. Are they
mes ⁵·ssss his own words that he speaks ? If thou despisest him, thou
ger despisest not him, but God that ordained him. But how does
it appear, thou askest, that he is ordained of God? Nay, if
thou suppose it otherwise, thy hope is rendered vain. For if
God worketh' nothing through his meanS, thou neither hast
any Laver, nor art partaker of the Mysteries, nor of the benefit
of Blessings3 thou art therefore not a Christian. What then,
you say, does God ordain all, even the unworthy? God in-
deed doth not ordain all, but He worketh through all, though
they be themselves unworthy, that the people may be saved.
