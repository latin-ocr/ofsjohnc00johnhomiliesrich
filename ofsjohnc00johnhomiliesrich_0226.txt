200 ἸῚιε Word not bound. Act done for tlte Elect.

2 Tm. bandman, you prevent his sowing, for he sows with his hand:

2, ¹⁰· but ·if you bind a Teacher, you hinder not the word, for it is
sown with his tongue, not with his hand. Our word there-
fore is not subjected to bonds. For though we are bound, that
is free, and runs its course. How? Because though bound,
behold, we preach. This is for the encouragement of those
that are free. For if we that are bound preach, much more
does it behove you that are loose to do so. You have heard
that I suffer these things, as an evil-doer. Be not dejected.
For it is a great wonder, that being bound I do the work of
those that are free, that being bound 1 overcome all, that
being bound I prevail over those that bound me. For it is
the word of God, not ours. Human chains cannot bind the
word of God. These thinys I suffer οη account Qf tlte elect.

Ver. 10. Therefore I endure all thinys, he sayS, for tlze
elect's sak-es, that they may also obtain tlte salvation which
is in Christ Jesus with eternal ylory.

Behold another incentive. Ι endure these thingS, he says,
not for myself, but for the salvation of others. It was in my
power to have lived free from danger3 to have suffered none
of these things, if I had consulted my own interest. On what
account then do Ι suffer these things? For the good of others, 2
that others may obtain eternal life. What then dost thou
promise thyself? He has not said, simply on account of
these particular persons3 but for tlte elect's sake. If God
has chosen them, it becomes us to suffer every thing for their
sakes. Tlcat they also may obtain salvatz‘on. By saying,
they alsa, he meanS, as well as we. For God hath chosen
us also 3 and as God suffered for our sakeS, so should we
suffer for their sakes. Thus it is a matter of retribution, not
of favour. On the part of God it was grace, for He having
received no previous benefit, hath done us good: but on our
parts it is retribution, we having previously received benefits
from God, suffer for these, for whom we suffer, in order that
they may obtain salvation. What sayest thou ? What sal-
vation ? Art thou who wast not the author of salvation
to thyself, but wast destroying thyself, art thou the author
of salvation to others? Surely not, and therefore he adds,
salvation that is in Christ Jesus ,· that which is truly salva—
tion‚ with elcrnal ylory. Present things are afflictive, but
