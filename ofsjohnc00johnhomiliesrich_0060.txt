34 St. Paul's humilitqs in representing] his own case.

1 ΤΙΜ. would not be so readily believed, as if they were to see this

1‚16. most wicked wretch actually pardoned. There could then
be no longer any doubt. This is what Paul sayS, that God,
willing to give men full assurance that He pardons all their
transgressionS, chose, as the object of His mercy, him who was
more a sinner than any3 for when I obtained mercy, he
argueS, there could be no doubt of others: as familiarly
speaking we might say, ‘ If God pardons such an one, He
will never punish any body 3’ and thus he shews that he
himself, though unworthy of pardon, for the sake of others’
salvation first obtained that pardon. Therefore, he sayS,
since I am saved, let no one doubt of salvation. And observe
the humility of this blessed man3 he says not, that in me He
miylit skew forth His Zonysufferioiy, but all lonysufferiny ,-
as if he had said, greater longsuffering He could not shew
in any case than in mine, nor find a sinner that so required
all His pardon, all His longsuffering3 not a part only, like
those who are only partially sinners, but all His longsuffer-
mg.

For α pattern to those who should hereafter believe. This
is said for comfort, for encouragementd. But because he had
spoken highly of the Son, and of the great love which He
hath manifested, lest he should be thought to exclude the
Father from this, he ascribes the glory to Him also,

Ver. 17. Now unio tlze Kiny eternal, immortal, invisible,

Amen.

For these thingS, then, we glorify not the Son only, but
the Father. Here let us argue with the heretics. Speaking
of the Father, he says, To the only God. Is the Son then not

ible. Or does He not possess that Himself, which hereafter He
will give to us? Yes, they say, He is God and immortal, but
not such as the Father. What then? is He of inferior essence,
and therefore of inferior immortality? What then is a greater ¹
and a less immortality? For immortality is nothing else than
the not being subject to destruction. For there is a greater
and a less glory3 but immortality does not admit of being

greater or less: as neither is there a greater and a less health.
