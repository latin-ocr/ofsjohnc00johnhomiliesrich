266 The Servant gains by losinyfor his Master's sake.

4, 22. 118, though we be overtaken by calamity, we shall feel no
distress, if that grace be with us and fortify us,

But how shall we draw down grace upon us ? By doing
what is pleasing to God, and obeying Him in all things. In
great houses do we not see those domestics in favour, who do
not regard their own interest, but with all zeal and alacrity
promote their masters', and who not from the compulsion of
the master, but from their own affection and good disposition,
order all things well. When they are always before their
eyes, when they are engaged in the house, when they are not Ἴ

but rather consider their masters’ concerns as their own.
For he who makes what is his own his master’s, does not
really give up his own -to his master, but makes 1116 interest
his own 3 he commands even as himself in his affairs g, and
rules equally with him. He is often as much feared by the
domestiCS, and whatever he says his master says too, and he
is henceforth dreaded by all his enemieS.

And if he who in worldly concerns prefers his master's in-
terests to his own, does not really neglect his own interest,
but rather advance it the more3 much more is this the case
in spiritual matters. Despise thine own concernS, and thou
wilt receive those of God. This He Himself wills. Despise
earth, and seize upon the kingdom of heaven. Dwell there,
not here. Be formidable there, not here. If thou art formi—
dable there, thou wilt be formidable not to men, but to
demons, and even to the devil himself. But if thy depend-
ence is on worldly wealth, thou wilt be contemptible to them,
and often to men too, Whatever be thy richeS, thou wilt be
rich in servile things, But if thou despisest these, thou wilt
be radiant in the house of the King.

Such were the Apostles, despising a servile house and
worldly wealth! And see how they commanded in the affairs
of their Master. ‘ Let one,’ they said, ‘ be delivered from
disease, another from the possession of devils: bind this
man, and loose that? This was done by them 011 earth, but
it was fulfilled as in Heaven. For, whatever ye shall bind on
