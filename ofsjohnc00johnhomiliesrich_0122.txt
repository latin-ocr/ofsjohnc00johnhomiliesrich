96 ,δ’ρὶνίίιιηί Food and Emere-ise.

For as we set before us day by day this bodily nourish-
ment, so he means, let us be continually receiving discourses
concerning the saith, and ever be nourished with them. What
is this, being] nourislzed up .? Ruminating upon them3 attending
ever to the same thingS‚ and practising ever the same, for it
is no common nourishment that they supply.

But refuse profane and old wives' sableS. By these are
meant Jewish traditions, and he calls them-fables² either be-
cause of their falsehood or their unseasonableness. For
what is seasonable is useful, but what is unseasonable is not
only useless but injuriOUS. Suppose a man of adult age to be
suckled by a nurse, would he not be ridiculOUS‚ because it
is unseasonable? Profane and old wives' sables, he calls
them, partly because of their obsoleteness, and partly because
they are impediments to saith. For to bring souls under sear,
that are raised above these things, is an impious command-
ment. Exere-ise thyseff unio yodlineSS. That is, unto a
pure saith and a moral life3 for this is godliness. So then
we need exercise.

Ver. 8. For bodily θωρνοίεθῑ prcfitetlc little.

This has by some been referred to sasting; but away with
such a notion ! for that is not a bodily but a spiritual exer-2
cise. If it were bodily it would nourish the body, whereas
it wastes and makes it lean, so that it is not bodily. Hence

κ’- 116 is not speaking of the discipline²² of the body. What we
, need, therefore‚is the exercise⁵ of the soul. For the exercise

of the body hath no profit, but may benefit the body a little,
but the exercised of godliness yields fruit and advantage both
here and hereaster.

This is a faithfial sayiwffi that is, it is true that godliness
is profitable both here and hereaster. Observe how every
where he brings in this, he needs no demonstration, but
simply declares it, for he was addressing Timothy.

So then even here, we have good hopes? For he who is
conscious to himself of no evil, and who has been fruitful in
good, rejoices even here: as the wicked man on the other
hand is punished here as well as hereaster. He lives in
perpetual sear, he can look no one in the face with con-

«³ ἄσκησις, the proper word for spiri· because bodily exercise for bodily pur-

tual exercite. St. Paul uses the other, poses was familiar to all Greeks.
