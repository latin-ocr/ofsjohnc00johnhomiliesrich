360 Met-cy <ff God requires mercy in us.

to obtain them? Blessed‚ He sayS‚ are the merc-{ful .· sor they ¹
shall obtain morey. For if men shew mercy to such, much
more will God, but to the unme1 clful by no means. For lle
shall leave Judqment without merey, that laath, shewed no
mercy.

An excellent thing is mercy! Why then hast thou not
done it to another? Dost thou wish to be pardoned‚ when
thou offendest? why then dost thou not thyself pardon him
who has offended thee? But thou comest to God, asking of
Him the kingdom of heaven, and thou thyself dost not give
money when it is begged of thee. For this cause we do not
obtain mercy, because we do not shew mercy. But why?
you say. Is not this also a part of mercy, to shew mercy to
the unmerciful? Nayel For he that treated with the greatest
kindness the hard-hearted cruel man, that had done number-
less ills to his neighbour‚ how should he be merciful? What
then, say you? Hath not the Laver saved ηε, who had com-

 

mitted infinite evils? It hath delivered us from them, not -
that we should commit them again, but that we may not ψ
commit them. For how shall we, it is said, that are dead to
εἰη, live any Zonyer therein?

What then? shall we sin because we are not under the law? ’
God forbid. For this cause God hath delivered thee from
those sins that thou mightest no more run back to that dis-
honour. Since even physicians relieve their severish patients
from their heat, not that they may abuse their health to
their injury and disorder‚ (since it would be better to be sick,
if one was about to use his health only that he might confine ,
himself again to his bed) but that having learnt the evils that
arise from sickneSS‚ they may no longer fall into the same, that
they may the more securely preserve their health, that they
may do every thing that conduces to its preservation.

How then? you say: what is the lovingkindness of God,
if he is not about to save the bad? For ostentimes I hear
many talking in this way, that He is the F riend of man, and
will by all means save all. That we may not therefore vainly
deceive ourselveS‚ (for I remember that I made a promise of
this kind to you,) come let us to day move this argument. 1
