¹ saying‚ If a man know not lzow to ναῖε his own house, how Hou-

skalt he take care of the Ghurck Qf' God? it was fit that hel {ivm-

of the house. He presided over the prison, not as over a
Ἴ prison, but as if it had been a house. For he alleviated the

calamities of all, and took charge of those who were imprisoned

 

as if they had been his own memberS, not only taking an
f interest in their misfortunes and consoling them, but if he
² ,saw any one absorbed in thought, he went to him andinquired
’ the cause, and could not bear even to see any one dejected,
or be easy till he had relieved his dejection. Such love as
this, many a one has not shewn even to his own children.
And to these things may be traced the beginning of his good
fortune. For our part must go before, and then the blessing of
God will follow.
For that he did shew this care and concern we learn from
’ the story. He saw, it is said, two eunuchs who had been
cast into prison by Pharaoh, his chief butler and chief baker,
and he said, Wherefore look ye so sadly to-day ? And not Gen.40,

ᾗ come him. This I have said to servants, that they may learn
that though they have masters that are very brutes, as this
{5 Egyptian, or ferocious as the keeper of the prison, they may
· gain their regard, and though they be heathen as they were,
⁴ or whatever they be, they may soon win them to gentleneSS.
ἕ For nothing is more engaging than good manners, nothing
21 more agreeable and delightful than meekneSS, gentleneSS, and
’ obedience. A person of this character is suitable to all. Such
'. an one is not ashamed of slavery, he does not avoid the poor,
ι the sick, and the infirm. For virtue is superior, and prevails
over every thing. And if it has such power in slaveS, how
= much more in those who are free? This then let us practise,
ε whether bond or free, men or women. Thus we shall be
