2 Tm. oughtest not to obey even Paul, if he speaks of himself, or
1’ ³²· any thing human, but the Apostle‚ that has Christ speaking ἶ
in him. Let not us judge one another’s conduct, but each ,³
his own. Examine thine own life. ³1
But thou sayest, ‘ He ought to be better than Ι.’ Where- 2⁵
fore ? ‘ Because he is a Priest.' And is he not superior to ’-
thee in his labourS, his dangerS, his anxious conflicts and
troubles? But if he is not better, oughtest thou therefore to ⁵4
destroy thyself? These are the words of arrogance ¹¹¹. For ,l
how is he not better than thyself? He steals, thou sayest‚
and commits sacrilege! How knowest thou this? Why dost .’
thou cast thyself down a precipice ? If thou shouldest hear
it said that such an one hath a purple roben, though thou ’
knewest it to be true, and couldest convict him, thou de· ’
clinest to do it, and pretendest ignorance, not being willing
to run into unnecessary danger. But in this case thou art so g
far from being backward, that even without cause thou ex· ἒ
posest thyself to the danger. Nor think thou art not respon· ff
Matt. sible for those words. Hear what Christ sayS, Every idle word
1²² 36. that men shall speak, they shall yive account thereos in the ⁵
day ofjudqment. And dost thou think thyself better than .
another, and dost thou not groan, and beat thy breast, and ,A
bow down thy head, and imitate the Publican? ’

And then thou destroyest thyseff, though thou be better.

Be silent, that thou cease not to be better. If thou speak of

it, thou hast done away the merit3 if thou thinkest it, I do not

say so ; if thou dost not think it, thou hast added much. For

if a notorious sinner, when he confessed, went komejustzfled,

he who is a sinner in a less degree, and is conscious of it, how

will he not be rewarded? Examine thy own life. Thou dost

not stea13 but thou art rapaciOUS, and overbearing, and guilty

of many other such things. I say not this to defend theft3

God forbid! I deeply lament if there is any one really guilty

of it, but Ι do not believe it. How great an evil is sacrilege,

it is impossible to say. But I spare yon. For I would not

that our virtue should be rendered vain by accusing others,

What was worse than the Publican? For it is true that he was a
