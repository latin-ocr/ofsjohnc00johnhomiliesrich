in his nearest interests. Dost thou see that it is wickedness 2
that is unclean? He who had two wives was not unclean,-1
and David who had many wives was not unclean, But
when he had one unlawfully, he became unclean. Why?
Because he had injured and defrauded his neighbour. And ²-
the fornicator is not unclean on account of the intercourse,
but on account of the manner of it, because it injures the
woman, and they injure one another, making the woman
common, and subverting the laws of nature. For she ought :
to be the wife of one man, since it is said, Male and female ’
created He them. And, they twain shall be oneflesh. Not . Ἰ

‘ those many,’ but they twain shall be one flesh. Here then -. ἵ

is injustice‚ and therefore the act is wicked. Again, when · ·
anger exceeds due measure, it makes a man unclean, notin ζ
itself, but because of its excess. Since it is not said, He ’

that is an-qry, merely, but (ιη-9η] without a cause. Thus .

every way to desire overmuch is unclean, for it proceeds
from a greedy and irrational disposition. Let us therefore -
be sober, Ι beseech yon, let us be pure, in that which is real ’τ
purity, that we may be thought worthy to see God, through ’
J esus Christ our Lord, with Whom‚ &c. ¹
