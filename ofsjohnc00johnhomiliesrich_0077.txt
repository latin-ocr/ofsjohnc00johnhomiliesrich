them, nay, pray against them? Thou thinkest indeed that -Xl'-
thou art inflicting a blow upon another, but in truth thou art
thrusting the sword against thyself. Thou sufferest not the

J udge to be lenient to thy own offenceS‚ by this way of
urging Him to anger against others. For, with what mea-sure Matt. 7,
με mete, He saith, it shall be measured to you aqain5 anfi ²⁰
with what judymenl ye judqe, με shall be judyed. Let us
therefore be disposed to pardon, that G-od may be so disposed
towards us‚

These things I wish you not only to hear, but to observess
For now the memory retains only the wordS‚ and perhaps
hardly those. And after we are separated, if any one who
was not present were to ask γοα, what had been our discourse,
some could not tell: others would know merely the subject
we had spoken of, and answer that there had been a Homily
upon the subject of forgiving injurieS, and praying for our
enemieS, but would omit all that had been said, as they could
not remember: others remember a little, but still somewhat.
If therefore you gain nothing by what you hear, I entreat
you not even to attend at the discourse. For of what use is
it? The condemnationis greater, the punishment more severe,
if after so many exhortations, we continue in the same course.
For this reason God has given us a definite form of prayer,
that we might ask for nothing human, nothing worldly. And
you that are faithful know what you ought to pray for, how
the whole Prayer is common. But one says, ‘ It is not
commanded there to pray for unbelievers.’ This you would
not say, is you understood the force, the depth, the hidden
treasure of that¹ Prayer. Only unfold it, and you find this¹Gr·the-
also comprised within it. For it is implied, When one says
in prayer, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in Hem-en.
Now, because in heaven there is no unbeliever, nor offender 3
if therefore it was for the faithful alone, there would be no
reason in that expression. If the faithful were to do the will
of God‚ and the unbelievers not to do it, His will were not
done in earth as isis in heaven. But it means 3 As there is
none wicked in heaven, so let there be none on earth3 but
draw all men to the fear of Thee, make all men angeIS, even1
those who hate us, and are our enemieS. Dost thou not see how
