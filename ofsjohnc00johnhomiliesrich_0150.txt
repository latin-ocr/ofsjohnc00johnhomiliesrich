124 Devotion3‚ indaecstry, meaZS, and sleep of the Monks.

Another visits the stage, another goes about his own
business. But these holy men, having performed their
morning prayers and hymns, proceed to the reading of the
Scriptures. There are some too that have learned to write
out bookS, each having 1118 own apartment assigned to him,
where he lives 111 perpetual quiet 3 no one is trifling, not one
speaks a word. Then at the third, sixth, and ninth 1101118,
and in the evening, they perform their devotions, having
divided the day into four partS, and at the conclusion of
each they honour God with psalms and hymnS‚ and whilst
others are dining, laughing, and sporting, and bursting with
gluttony, they are occupied with their hymnS. For they
have no time for the table, nor sor these things of sense.
After their meal ‘³ they again pursue the same course, having
previously given themselves a while to sleep. The men of
the world sleep during the day: 11111 111080 watch during the
night. Truly children of light are they! And while the

from their labours, then betake themselves to their table, not
calling up a multitude of servants, nor throwing the house
into bustle* and confusion, nor setting before them high-
seasoned dishes, and rich-steaming viands, but some only
partaking of bread and salt, to which others add oil, whilst
the weakly have also herbs and pulse. Then after sitting a short
time, or rather after concluding all with hymnS, they each
go to rest upon a bed made for repose only and not for
luxury. There is no dread of magistrates, no lordly arrogance,
no terror of slaves, no disturbance of women or children, no
multitudes of chests‚ or superfluous laying by of garmentS,
no gold or silver, no guards and sentinels, no storehouse.
Nothing of all these, but all there is full of prayer, of hymns,
and of a spiritual savour. Nothing carnal is there. They
fear no attacks of robberS, having nothing of which they can
