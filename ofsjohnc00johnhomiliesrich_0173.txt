Slavery under man but αή accident. 147

< forbearance the sear of their master enforces among domestiCS, HqM·
and seldom will you see a servant robbing or injuring a XWIU

fellow-servant. But among free men it is quite the reverse.

 

y We bite and devour one another. We· sear not our Master:

we rob and plunder our felloW-servants, we strike them in

His very sight. This the servant will not do; if he strikeS,

it is not when his master sees him3 if he revileS, it is not
when his master hears him. But we dare do any thing,
though God sees and hears it all.

The fear of their master is ever before their eyeS, the sear
of our Master never before ourS. Hence the subversion of
all order, hence all is confusion and destruction. And we
never take into consideration the offences we have committed,
but if our servants do amiss, we call them to a rigorous
account for every thing, even to the least misdemeanour.

Ι say not this to make servants remiSS, but to chide our
supineneSS, to ronse us from our sloth, that we may serve our

God with as much zeal as servants do their master3 our
Maker, as faithfully as our fellow-creatures ¹ serve us, from :55:⁰⁰4
whom they have received no such gift. For they too are

free bynature. To them also it was said, Let them leave 2G6en. 1,
dominion ovea· the fishes. For this slavery is not from ’
nature: it is the result of some particular cause, or circum-
stances Yet, notwithstanding, they pay us great honour3

and We with great strictness exact services from them, whilst

to God we hardly render the smallest portion, though the
advantage of it would redound to ourselves. For the more
zealously we serve God, the greater gainers we shall be.

Let us not then deprive ourselves of such important benefitS.

For God-is sels-sufficient, and wants nothing3 the recom-
pense and the advantage reverts altogether to us. Let us
therefore, 1 beseech γοα, be so affected, as serving not God

but ourselves, and with sear and trembling let us serve Him,

’ that we may obtain the promised blessingS, through Jesus

 

Christ our Lord, with Whom, &Q
