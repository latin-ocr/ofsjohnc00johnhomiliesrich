2 Tm, faithful: He cannot deny Himself: that is, if we believe
²² 15. not that He rose again, He is not injured by it. He is faith-
ful and unshaken, whether we say so or not. 'Is then He is Α
not at all injured by our denying Him, it is for nothing else ,
than for our benefit that He desires our confession. For He J
abideth the same, whether we deny Him or not. He cannot ὶ
deny Himself‚ that is, His own Being. We may say that ji
He is not3 though such is not the fact. It is not in His nature, 3
it is not possible for Him not to be, that is, to go into non· ἶ

entity⁸. His subsistence always abideS, always is. Let us

 

   

not therefore be so affected, as if we could gratify or could ·-’
injure Him. But lest any one should think ‘that Timothy
needed this advice, he has added,

Of these thirty-s· put them in remembrance, charyinq them
before the ,Lord, that they Str-ive not about words to no profit, »
but to tlze sabvertinq qf the hearers, It is an overawing }
thing to call God to witness what we say, for if no one would
dare to set* at nought the testimony of man when appealed to,
much less when the appeal is to God. If any one, for
instance, entering into a contract, or making his will, chooses
to call witnesses worthy of credit, would any transfer the
things to those who are not included? Surely not. And
even if he wishes it, yet fearing the credibility of the wit-
nesses‚ he avoids it. What is chmyiny them before the
Lord? he calls God to witness both what was said, and what

was done.

Tlcat they strive not· about words to no prQfit; and not
merely so, but to the subvertiny of tlte hearers, Not only is
there no gain from it, but much harm. Of these thinys then
put them in remembrarcee, and if they despise thee, God
will judge them. But why does he admonish them not to

that the human soul is ever prone to contend and to dispute
