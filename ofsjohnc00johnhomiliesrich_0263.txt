2 TIM. iii. 1-4.

This know also, that in the last day-s· periton-s* times shall
come. For men shall be lovers os their own solves, oovetous,
boasters, pro-ud, blaspltemers, disobedient to parents, un-
tleankful, unlzoly, Without natural affection, truce-
bream-rs, false accusem, incontinent, fierce, despisers of
those that are qood, TraitorS, lieadps, hiylz-minded, lovers
ofpleasurea more than lovers of God.

IF any now takes offenoe at tho existence of heretiCS, let
him remember that it was so from the beginning, the devil
always Setting up error by the side of truth. God from the
beginning promised good, the devil came too with a promise.
God planted Paradise, the devil deceived, saying, ἴε shall Gen. 3,
be as yods. For as he could shew nothing in actions, he5‘

- made the more promises in words. Such is the character of

deceivers. After this were Cain and Abel, then the sons of
Seth and the daughters of men3 afterwards Ham and J aphet,
Abraham and Pharaoh, Jacob and Esau3 and so is it even
to the end, Moses and the magio-iaus, the Prophets and the
false prophetS, the Apostles and the false apostleS, Christ
and Antichrist. Thus it was then, both before and at that
time. Then there was Theudas, then Simon, then were the
ApostleS, then too this party of Hermogenes and Philetus.
In short, there was no time when falsehood was not set up
in opposition to truth. Let us not therefore be distressed.
That it would be s0‚ was foretold from the beginning.
