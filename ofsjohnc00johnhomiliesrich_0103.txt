Every virtue is implied in this word3 so that if any one be
conscious to himself of any sinS, he doth not well to desire

 

an office for which his own actions have disqualified him.
For such an one ought to be ruled, and not to rule others·
For he who bears rule should be brighter than any luminary3
his life should be unspotted, so that all should look up to
him, and make his life the model of their own. But in
employing this exhortation, he had no common object in
view. For he too1 was about to appoint Bishops, (whichli. e.
also he exhorts Titus to do in his Epistle to him,) and as it ἕξω·
was probable that many would desire that office, therefore hc
urges these admonitions. Viqilant, he sayS, that is, circum-

having the eyes of his mind dimmed. For many things

occur which permit not a man to see clearly, to see things as

in these respects they ought to be equal to those who rule
over them,) he, to shew what is peculiar to the BishopS, adds,
apt to teach. For this is not required of him that is ruled, but
is most essentia] to him who has this rule committed to him ''.

Not yiven to wine: here he does not so much mean in-
