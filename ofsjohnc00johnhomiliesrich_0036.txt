work whatever! For whether you will or not, things will pro-
ceed according to the course of nativity! What need have
we more of Prayer? And why should you deserve to be a
Christian, if there be this nativity? for you will not then
be responsible. And whence proceed the arts of life? are
these too from nativity? YeS, you say, and it is fated to one to
become wise with labour. But can you shew me one who
has learnt an art without labour? You cannot. It is not
then from nativity but from labour that he derives his skill.
But why does a man who is corrupt and wicked become rich,
without inheriting it from his father, while another, amidst
infinite labourS, remains poor? For such are the questions
they raise, always arguing upon wealth and poverty, and
never taking the case of vice and virtue. Now in this ques-
tion talk notos that, but shew me a man who has become
bad, whilst he was striving to be good3 or one that, without
striving, has become good. For if Fate has any power, its
power should be shewn in the most important things 3 in vice
and virtue, not in poverty and riches. Again you ask, why is
one man sickly and another healthy? why is one honoured,
another disgraced? Why does every thing succeed well with
this man, whilst another meets with nothing but failure and
impediments? Lay aside the notion of nativity, and you
will know. Believe firmly that there is a God and a Provi—
dence, and all these things will be cleared up. ‘ But Ι can-
not,' you say, ‘ conceive that there is a Providence, when there
is such disorder. Can 1 believe that the good Grod gives
wealth to the fornicator, the corrupt and dishonest man, and
not to the virtuous? How can l believe this? for there must
be facts to ground belief? Well then, do these cases pro:
ceed from a nativity that was just, or unjust? ‘ Unjust,’ you
say. Who then made it? ‘ Not God,’ you say, ‘it was unbe-
gotten.’ But how can the unbegotten produce these things?
for they are contradictions. ‘ These things are not then in
any wise the works of God? Shall we then inquire who
made the earth, the sea, the heavenS, the seasons ? ‘ N ativity,’
you answer. Did nativity then produce in things inanimate
such order and harmony, but in us, for whom these things
were made, so much disorder? As if one, in building a
