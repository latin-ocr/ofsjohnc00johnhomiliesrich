That he may not plunge Timothy into dejection by giving

“f him orders about such manem, he sayS‚ I write thus not as
though'I were not coming, but I will indeed come, still in
- case I should be delayed, that thou mayest not be distressed.

ἶ And this he writes to him to prevent his being dejected, but

to others in order to Δ rouse them to greater earnestneSS.
*² For his presence, though only promised, would have great
ἓ, effect. Nor let it seem strange that, though foreseeing every
s thing through the Spirit, he was yet ignorant of this, and
‚ ³ v only sayS, I hope to come, but if I tarry, which implies un-

act stomhis own inclination, he was naturally uncertain about
, this matter.

Tkat thou mayest know, he says, how thou ouyhtest to

bellave thyseff in the house of God, which is the Charch of

this mystery, and thou mayest be struck with awe: soritis

’Ῑ, indeed a yreat mys-tery, and a mystery ofyodlineSS, and that
'without‘ controversy or question, for it is beyond all doubt.
“’ Since in his directions to the Priests he had required nothing

like what is found in LeviticuS, he refers the whole matter to

Another, saying, God was rnanv'fest in tlceflesle. The Creator

was seen incarnate. He was justified in the Spirit. As it
is said, Wisdom is justffied of lter children, or because He
