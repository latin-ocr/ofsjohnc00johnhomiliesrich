offends in a higher degree, and he who offends an inferior
one in a lower degree3 but he who insults the king offends
much more. The injury indeed is the same, but it becomes
greater by the excellence of the person. And if he who
insults a king receives intolerable punishment, on account of χ
the superiority ‘¹ of the person, for how many talents will he ³
be answerable who insults God? so that even if we should
commit the same offences against God, that we do against
men, even so it is not an equal thing: but as great as is the
difference between God and men, so great is that between⁴
the offences against Him and them.

But now I find also that the offences exceed‚ not only ln
that they become great by the eminence of the person, but
by their very nature. And it is a horrible saying that I am
about to utter, and truly awful, but it is necessary to be said,
that it may even so shake our minds and strike them with
terror, shewing that we sear men much more than God, and
we honour men much more than God. For consider, he
that commits adultery knows that God sees him, yet he
disregards H im3 but if a man see him, he restrains his lust.
Does not such a one not only honour men above God, not
only insult God, but, which is even much more dreadful,
whilst he fears them, despise Him? For if he see them,
he restrains the flame of lust, but rather what flame? it is
not a flame, but a wilfulness. For if indeed it was not lawful
to have intercourse with a woman, the matter perhaps would·
be a flame, but now Ε it is insult and wantonness. For if he
should see men, he desists from his mad passion, but for the
longsuffering os G-od he has less regard. Again, another
who steals, is conscious that he is committing robbery, and
endeavours to deceive men, and defends himself against
those who accuse him, and clothes his apology with a fair
shoxv3 but though he cannot thus prevail with God, he does
not regard Him, nor stand in awe of Him, nor honour Him. ’
