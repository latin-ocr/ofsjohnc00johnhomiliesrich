The Eucharist always a holy Passover. 45

sidering that you are seared by partaking unworthily, though
only once, but to receive worthily, though often, is salutary.
It is not presumptuous to receive often, but to receive unwor-
thily, though but once in a whole life. But we are so misera-
bly foolish, that, though we commit numberless offences in
the course of a year, we are not anxious to be absolved from
them, but are satisfied, that we do not osten make bold im-
pudently to insult the Body of Christ, not remembering that
those who crucified Christ, crucified Him but once. Is the
offence then the leSS, because committed but once? Judas
betrayed his Master but once. What then, did that exempt
him from punishment? Why indeed is time to be considered
¹ in this matter? let our time of coming be when our conscience
is pure. 'The Mystery at Easter is not of more efficacy than
that which is now celebrated. It is one and the same. There
is the same grace of the spirit, it is always a Passoverg. Yon
who are initiated know this, On the Preparationh, on the
Sabbath, on the Lord's day, and on the day of MartyrS,
it is the same Sacrifice that is performed. For as qften, he 1 Cor.

Lord's death. No time is limited for the performance of
this Sacrifice, why then is it then called the Paschal feasti?
Because Christ suffered for us then. Let not the time, there-
fore, make any difference in your approach. There is at all
times the same power, the same dignity, the same grace, one
and the same body, nor is one celebration os it more or less
holy than another. And this you know, who see upon these
occasions nothing new, save these worldly veiIS, and a more
splendid attendance. The only thing that these days have
more is that from them commenced the day of our salvation
when Christ was sacrificed. But with respect to these
mysterieS‚ those days have no further pre-eminence.

When you approach to take bodily food, you wash your hands
and your mouth, but when you draw nigh to this spiritual food,
you do not cleanse your soul, but approach full ofuncleanness.
