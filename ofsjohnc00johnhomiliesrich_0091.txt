ἰῇ move those things which are only the indications of wealth‚

as gold, and pearIS, and costly array3 how much more those

f* things which imply studied ornament, as painting‚ colouring

and wanton look3 the exquisite care in putting on the cloak

shoes? For he glauces at all these thingS, in speaking of
modest apparel and ShamefacedneSS. For such things are
shameless and indecent.

Bear with me, I beseech· you, for it is not my aim by this
plain reproof to wound or pain you, but to remove from my
flock all that is unbecoming to them. But if these prohibi-
tions are addressed to those who have husbandS‚ who are
rich, and live luxuriously3 much more to those who have
professed virginity. But what virgin, you say, wears gold, or
broidered hair? Yet there may be such a studied nicety in a
simple dress, as that these are nothing to it. Yon may study
appearance in a common garment more than those who wear
gold. For when a very dark coloured robe is drawn closely
round the breast with the girdle, (as dancers on the stage are
attired,) with such nicety that it may neither spread into breadth
nor shrink into scantiness, but be between both; and when the
bosom is set off with many folds, is not this more alluring than
any silken robes? and when the shoe, shining through its
blackness, ends in a sharp point, and imitates the elegance of
painting‚ so that even the breadth of the sole is scarce
visible—or when though you do not indeed paint the face, you
spend much time and pains on washing it, and spread a veil
across the forehead b, whiter than the face itself—and above
that put on a hood ¹, of which the blackness may set off the ¹ oden.
white by contrast—-is there not in all this the vanity of dress?
What can one say to the perpetual rolling of the eyes? to the
putting on of the stomacher so artfully as sometimes to con-
ceal, sometimes to disclose, the fastening? For this too they
sometimes expose‚ so as to shew the exquisiteness of the cincture,
