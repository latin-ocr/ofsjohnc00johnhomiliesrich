HOMILY II.

PfflL. i. 4, 5, 6.

Ι thanlc my God, making] mention of thee always in my
prayerS, Heariny of thy love and saith, which tlzou least
towards tlte Lord JesuS‚ and toward all saints, That

 

tlte communication of tlzy saith may become effeetual
by tlte ackrzowledyinq of every qood thirty wltielz is in πει, 3 E. V.
in Christ JesuS. ²⁷² ΨΜ·

ΗΕ does not immediately at the eommencement ask the
favour, but having first admired the man, and having praised
him for his good actions, and having shewn no small proof of
¹ his love, that he always made mention of him in his prayers‚
and having said that many are refreshed by him, and that he
’ is obedient and oomplying in all things3 then he puts it last

of all, by this particularly putting him to the blush². For if ² {vow-
others obtain the things which they ask, much more Paul. Ifw·
coming before otherS‚ he was worthy to obtain, much more
when he comes after others, and asks a thing not pertaining
to himself, but in behalf of another. Then, that he may not
ss seem to have written on this account only, and that no one

may say, ‘ If it were not for Onesimus thou wouldest not have
written,' see how he assigns other causes also of his Epistle.
In the first place manifesting his love, then also desiring that
a lodging may be prepared for him.

Heariny, he sayS, of thy love.

This is wonderful, and much greater than if being present
