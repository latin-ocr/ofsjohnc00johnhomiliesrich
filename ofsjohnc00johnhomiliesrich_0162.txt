136 Vanity of earthly thinys.

looked upon as a mere fab1e‚ as a matter of derision3 no one
fears it, no one weeps or beats his breast at the thought of it.
The stream of fire is boiling up, the flame is kindled, and we
are laughing‚ taking our pleasure, and sinning without sear.
No one even bears in mind That Day. No one considers that
present things are passing away, and that they are but tem-
poral, though events are every day crying out and uttering a
fearsul voice. The untimely deathS, the changes that take
place in our lives, our own infirmities and diseases, fail to
instruct us. And not only in our own bodies are these
changes visible, but in the elements themselves. Every day in
our different ages we experience a kind of death, and in
every case instability is the characteristic of things we see.
Neither winter, nor summer, nor spring, nor autumn, is per-
manent 3 all are running, fiying, and flowing past. Why
should I speak of fading fiowers, of ‹lignities, of kings that
are to-day, and to-morrow cease to be, osrich men, of mag-
nificent houses, of night and day, of the sun and the moon?
for the moon wanes, and the sun is sometimes eclipsed, and
osten darkened with clouds? Of things visible, in short, is
there any thing that endures for ever? Nothing! No, nor
any thing in us but the soul, and that we neglect. Of things
subject to change we take abundant care, as if they were
permanent: but that which is to endure for ever we neglect,
as if it were soon to pass away. Some one is enabled to
perform mighty actions, but they shall last till to-mmrow, and
then he perishes, as we see in the instances of those who
have had yet greater power, and are now to be seen no more.
Life is a dream, and a scene3 and as on the stage when the
scene is shifted the various pageants disappear, and as dreams
flit away when the sunbeams rise, so here when the end comeS,
whether the universal or that of each one, all is dissolved
and vanishes away. The tree that you have planted remainS,
and the, house that you have built, it too stands on. But the
planter and the builder go away, and perish. Yet these things
happen without our regarding it, and we live on in luxury
and pleasure, and are ever furnishing ourselves with such
things, as if we were immortal.

Hear what Solomon sayS‚ who knew the present world by
actual experience. J builded me hou-5³65, J planted me vine-
