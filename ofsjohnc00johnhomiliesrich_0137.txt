But you still ask, how is the body dissolved whilst it yet (4)

eats and drinks? Surely this is no sign of human life, since
creatures without reason too eat and drink. Where the soul lies
dead, what do eating and drinking avail? The dead body, that
is invested with a flowery garment, is not benefited by it, and
