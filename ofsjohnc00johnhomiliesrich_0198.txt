Ps. 144,

172 Sorrow cannot be escaped, but may be a φαίη.

perience. He that is childless considers nothing so sad as
to be without children3 he that is poor, and has many children,
complains of the extreme evils of a large family. He who
has but one, looks upon this as the greatest misery, because
that one, being set too much store by, and never corrected,
becomes wilful, and brings grief upon his father. He who has
a beautiful wife, thinks nothing so bad as having a beautiful
wife, because it is the occasion of jealousy and intrigue.
He who has an ugly one, thinks nothing worse than
having a plain wife, because it is constantly disagreeable.
The private man thinks nothing more mean, more useleSS, than
his mode of life. The soldier declares that nothing is more
toilsome, more periIOUS, than warfare3 that it would be better
to live on bread and water than endure such hardships. He
that is in power thinks there can be no greater burden than
to attend to the necessities of others. He that is subject to
that power, thinks nothing more servile than living at the ³
beck of others. The married man considers nothing worse
than a wife, and the cares of marriage. The unmarried de-
clares there is nothing so wretched as being unmarried, and
wanting the repose of a home. The merchant thinks the
husbandman happy in his security. The husbandman thinks
the merchant so in his wealth. In short, all mankind are
somehow hard to please, and discontented and impatient.
When condemning the whole race, he saith, Man is a thing)
anouqkt, implyin g that the whole kind is a wretched unhappy
creature. How many long for old age! How many think
youth a happy time! Thus each different period has its un-
happiness. When we find ourselves censured 011 account of
our youth, we say, why are we not old? and when our heads
are hoary, we ask whither has our youth flown ? NumberleSS,
in short, are the occasions of sorrow. There is one path only
by which this unevenness can be escaped. It is the path of
virtue. Yet that too has its sorrOWS, only they are sorrows
not unprofitable‚ but productive of gain and advantage. For
if any one has sinned, he washes away his sin by the com-
punction that comes of his sorrow. Or, if he has grieved in
sympathizing with a fallen brother, this is not without its re-
compense. For sympathy with those that are in misery
gives us great confidence towards God.
