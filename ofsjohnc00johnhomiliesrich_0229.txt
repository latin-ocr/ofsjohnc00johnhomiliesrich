despised the Roman, rich as he waS, and emperor, and ruling Hom.
over all, who enriched so many thousands3 and with IV.
all his armies he availed nothing. Who then was illustrious?
who venerable? He that in chains was a conqueror, or 116
thatin 6 purple robe was conquered? He that standing
below, smote, or he that sitting above, was smitten ? He that
commanded and was despised, or he who was commanded
and made no account of the commands? He who being
alone was 171010110118, 01 116 who with numerous armies was
defeated? The ki'ng therefore so came off, that his prisoner
triumphed over him. Tell me then on whose side you
would be? For do not look to what comes afterwardS, but
to what was then their state. Would you be on the side of
Ner0, or of Paul? I speak not according to the estimate of
161111, 101 11161 18 11161111681; but according to the estimate 01
glory, and reverence, and preeminence. Any man of right
understanding would say, on the side 01 Paul. For 11 10
conquer is more illustrious 111611 10 be conquered‚ 116 18 111016
gloriOUS. And this is not yet much, that 116 conquered‚ but
that being in so mean a state he conquered one in so exalted
a condition. For I say, and will not cease to repeat it,
though bound with a chain, yet he smote him that was
invested with a diadem.

Such is the power 01 Christ. The chain surpassed the (4)
kingly crown, and this apparel was shewn more brilliant than
that. Clothed in filthy ragS, as the inhabitant 01 6 prison,
he turned all eyes upon the chains that hung on him, rather
111611 011 1116 purple robe. He stood on earth bound down
and stooping low, and all 1611 1116 tyrant mounted on a golden
01161101 10 gaze 011 him. And-well they might. For it was
customary‘to see a king with white 1101868, but it was a
strange and unwonted sight to behold a prisoner conversing
with a king with as much confidence as a king would con-
verse with a pitiful and. wretched slave. The surrounding
multitude were all slaves of the king, yet they admired not
their lord, but him who was superior 10 their lord. And he
before whom all feared and trembled, was trampled upon by
one,solitary man. See then how great was the brightness
01 111686 very chains!

And 1171161 need to mention what followed 61161 111686 things?
