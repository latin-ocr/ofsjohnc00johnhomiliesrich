It is well said, who know the truth. The former things then
were a type. For nothing is unclean by nature, but it be-
comes so through the conscience of him that partakes of it.
And what was the object of the prohibition of so many
meats? To restrain excessive luxury. But had it been
said, ‘ eat not for the sake of luxury,' it would not have been
borne. They were therefore shut up under the necessity of
the laW, that they might abstain from the stronger principle
of sear. The fish was not forbidden, though it was mani-
festly more unclean than the swine. But they might have
learned how pernicious luxury was from that saying of
MoseS, Jeshurmz wax-ed fat, and kioked. Another cause of
these prohibitions might be, that being straitened for other
food, they might be reduced to slaughter sheep and oxen3 he
therefore restrained them from other things, on account of
Apis and the calf, which was an abomination, ungrateful,
polluted, and profane ⁸.

Put them in remembrance os these thinys, meditate upon¹¹
these thinyS, for by the expression, nourished up in the
words qfflzith and sound doctrine, is implied that he should
not only recommend these things to others, but himself
practise them. For he sayS, Nou-rished up in the words of
saith, and os =qood, doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
But refuse prqfkme and old wives’ sableS. Why does he not
say, abstain from them, but resuse ,9 He thus intimates that
they should be utterly rejected. His meaning is, that he
should not enter into any disputation with the teachers of
them, but recommend to his own people the things prescribed
above. For nothing is to be gained by contending with
perverse men, unless where it might have an injurious effect,
if we were supposed from weakness to decline arguing with ἶ
them.

But exercise thysegf unio qonstiness, that is, unto a pure life,
and the most virtuous conversation. He that exerciseth him-
self, even when it is not the season of contest, acts always as
if he were contending, practises abstinence, endures all toils,
