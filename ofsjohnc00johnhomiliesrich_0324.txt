2'1‘ things unolean Therefore scrupulous observances are no *f
mark of purity, but it is the part of purity to be bold in all f?
things. For he that is pure by nature ventures upon all 5
things, they that aro defiled, upon nothing. This we may ⁷³
say against Marcion. Seest thou that it is a mark os purity
to be superior to all defilement, to touch nothing implics ¹
impurity. This holds even with respect to God. That He
assumed flesh is a proof of purity3 if through fear He had
not taken it, there would have been defilement. He who
eats not things that seem unolean, is himself unolean and
weak, he who eatS, is neither. Let us not call such pure, ,¹
they are the unclean. He is pure, who dares to feed upon ἷ
311 things. All this caution we ought to exercise towards
the things that defile the soul. For that is uncleanness, that ς
is defilement. None of these things is so. Those who have ’ζ
3 vitiated palate think what is set before them is unolean,
but this is the effect of their disorder. It becomes us there-
fore to understand the nature of things pure, and things
unclean.

sin is a leprosy, various and multiform. And that they had ’
this meaning, appears from what follows For if the leprosy
is general, and overspreads the whole body, he is clean 3 if it s
is partial, he is unclean. Thus you see that what is various
and changeable is the unolean thing. He again whose seed
passes from him is unolean, consider one that is so in soul,
casting away his seed. He who is uncircumcised is unclean.
These things are not allegorical1 but typical, for he who does

not cut off the wickedness of his heart is the unolean person.
