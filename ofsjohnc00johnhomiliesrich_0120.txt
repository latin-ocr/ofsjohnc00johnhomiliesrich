But what is expres-ely? Plainly, clearly, and beyond doubt.

-42 1'3· Marvel not, he sayS, if some having departed from the saith

 

still adhere to Judaism. There will be a time, when even
those who have partaken of the saith will fall into a worse
error, not only with respect to meats, but to marriages, and
other such thingS, introducing the most pernicious notions.
This refers not to the J eWS, (for tlze latter timeS, and a depar-
ture from thesaitlz, is not applicable to them 3) but to the Ma-
nichees, and the founders of these sects. And he calls them
very justly, seduciny spiritS, since it was by these they were
actuated in speaking such things. Spealciny lies in hypocrisy.
This implies that they utter not these falsehoods through ig-
norance and unknowingly, but as acting a part, knowing
the truth, but leaving] their conscience seared, that is, being

men of evil lives.
But why does he speak only of these heretics? Christ had

, before said, Offences must need come, and He had predicted
· the same in his parable of the sower, and of the springing up

of the tares, But here admire with me the prophetie gift of
Paul, whO, before the times in which they were to appear,
specifies the time itself. As if he had said, Do not wonder,
if, at the commencement of the saith, some endeavour to bring
in these pernicious doctrines3 since, aster it has been esta-
blished for a length of time, many shall depart from the saith.
Forbiddiny tc marry, and commandiny to abstain from meat-5.
Why then has he mentioned no other heresies? Though not
particularized, they are implied by the expressions of se-
ducitis] spirits and doctrines Qf deviZS. But he did not wish
to instil these things into the minds of men before the time,
but that which had already commenced, the case of meatS,
he specifies. Which God ῘιαίΙι created to be received with
tlzanlcsyiviny of them which believe and know the truth.
Why did he not say, by the unbelievers too? How by the
unbelieverS, when they exclude themselves from them by
their own rules? But is not luxury forbidden? Certainly
it is. But why? if good things are created to be received.
Because He created bread, and yet too much is forbidden;
and wine aISO, and yet excess is forbidden; and we are not
commanded to avoid dainties as if they were unclean in
themselveS, but as they corrupt the soul by exceSS.
