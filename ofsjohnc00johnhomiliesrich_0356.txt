Trrus whom men had bound, the fire set free. As if certain persons
3,12. were delivered up to the servants of their friendS, and the
servants, from regard to the friendship of their master, instead
of injuring thern, should treat them with much respeet3 so the
fire, when as it knew that the Three Children were the friends
of its Lord, burst their fetters, set them free, and let them go,
and became to them as a pavement, and was trodden under

I should like ‘to tell you an instructive story, which has
much of profit in it. What then is it? Once, when a per-
seeution arose, and a severe war was raging against the
Chureh, two men were apprehended. The one was ready to
suffer any thing whatever3 the other was prepared to submit
with firmness to be beheaded, but with fear and trembling
shrunk from other tortures. Observe then the dispensation
towards these men. When the judge was seated, he ordered
