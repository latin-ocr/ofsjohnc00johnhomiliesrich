:is implied by Reqeneration. For as when a house is in a Hom.
‘ruinous state no one places props under it, nor makes any V.
addition to the old building, but pulls it down to its found-
ations, and rebuilds it anew3 so in our case, God has not

 

repaired us, but has made us anew. For this is the renewz'nq
ofthe Holy Ghost. He has made us new men. How? By
H'z's Spirin and to shew' this further, he adds,

Ver. 6. Which He shed on» us abundantly tlerouyh Jesus
Christ our Saviour.

Thus we need the Spirit abundantly.

That beiny justified by His qrace——again by grace and
not by debt—we may be made heirs accordiwq to the hope of
θέεν-παῖ life.

At the same time there is an incitement to humility,
and a hope for the future. For if when we were so aban-
doned, as to require to be born again, to be saved by grace,
ἶ- to have no good in us, if then He saved us, much more will
He save us in the world to come.

For nothing was worse than the brutality of mankind before (4)
‚ the coming of Christ. They were all affected towards each

¹ other as 'if enemies and at war. Fathers slew their own sons,
and mothers were mad against their children. There was no
order settled, no natural, no written law3 every thing was sub-
verted. There were adulteries continually, and murders, and
things if possible worse than murders, and thefts; indeed we

are told by one of the heathen, that this practice was esteemed

a point of virtue. And naturally, since they worshipped a
god¹ of such character. Their oracles frequently required1 Mer-
them to put such and such men to death. Let me tell you ⁰¹³5
one of the stories of that time. One Androgeus, the son of
Minos, coming to AthenS, obtained a victory in wrestling, for
which he was punished and put to death. Apollo therefore,
remedying one evil by another, ordered twice seven youths to

be executed on his account. What could be more savage
than this tyrannica] command? And it was executed too.

A man undertook to atone the mad rage of the demon, and
slew these young men, because the deceit of the oracle pre-
vailed with them. But afterwards, when the young men
resisted and stood upon their defence, it was no longer done.

lf now it had been just, it ought not to have been prevented,
