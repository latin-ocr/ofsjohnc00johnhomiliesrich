142 Responsibz'lity in Layinq on qf hands,

l Tm. making his appeal to Them against that future Day, that if
5⁷2¹'23’ any thing should be done that ought not to be done, he was
clear from the guilt of it.

That thou observe these thinys without prefer-riom one
before another, doing] nothiny by partiality. That is, that
thou deal impartially and equally between those who are
upon trial and are to be judged by thee, that no one may pre-
occupy thy mind, or gain thee over to his side beforehand.

cause of them, by placing him in that station, and of the
past too, for not leaving him to mourn over them, and to
be in compunction. For as thou art a partaker of his good
actionS, so art thou of his sins.

Keep thyselfpure. This he says with reference to chas-
tity.

Drink no longer water, but use a little winesor thy sto-
