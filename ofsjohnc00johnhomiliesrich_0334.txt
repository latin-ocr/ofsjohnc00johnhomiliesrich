'1711‘th who had trusted us and whom we had trusted, and who had

2' 16. received many kindnesses stom us. He did not consider
with himself, nor say, What! have I taken a servant into
my house, shared with him my substance, made him free,
and even greater than myself, and is this the return that
he makes me? He did not say this, so much was his mind ¹
prepossessed by his previous respect for him.

And what wonder if he enjoyed so much honour in the
house, when we see What great regard he obtained even in a
prison. You know how practised in cruelty are the dis-
positions of those who have the custody of prisons. They
profit hythe missortunes of otherS, and harass those whom
others support in their affiictionS, making a gain of them that
is truly deplorable, with a more than brutal cruelty. 'For
they take advantage of those wretched circumstances which
ought to excite their pity. And we may further observe, that
they do not treat in the same manner all their prisoners3 for
those who are confined upon accusation only, and who are
injuriously treated, they perhaps pity, but they punish with
numberless inflictions those who are imprisoned for shameful
and atrocious crimes. So that the keeper of the prison not
only from the manner of such men might have been expected
to be inhuman, but from the cause for which he was impri-
soned. For who would not have been incensed against a
young man, who having been raised to so great honour, was
charged with requiting such favours by a base attempt upon
his master's wife. Would not the keeper, considering these
things, the honour to which he had been raised, and the
crime for which he was imprisoned, would he not have treated
him with more than brutal cruelty? But he was raised above
all these things by his hope in God. For the virtue of the
soul can mollify even wild beasts. And by the same meekness
which had gained his master, he captivated also the keeper
of the prison. Thus J oseph was again a ruler, he ruled in
the prison as he had ruled in the house. For since he was
destined to reign, it was fit that he should learn to be
governed, and while he was governed he became a governor,
and presided in the house.
