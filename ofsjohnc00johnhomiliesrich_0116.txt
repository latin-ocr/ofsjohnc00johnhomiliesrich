90 Trae RiclceS. How to take riches hence with us.

need little, is to be rich indeed. The king, so long as he
wants aught, differs not from the poor man. For this is

 

poverty, to stand in need of others3 and by this argument the

king is poor, in so far as he stands in need of his subjectS.

But he that is crucified to the world is not so3 he wants for

nothing3 for his hands are sufficient for his subsistence‚ as

facts 20, Paul said, These hands have min-islered to my necessities,

water to the boundless ocean. This wealth is not a posses-

house is more truly perchance the owner of it, for the owner

dies, and the tenant liveS, and still enjoys the house. And if

the latter hires it, the other might be said to hire it too:

for he built it,'and was at pains with it, and fitted it up.

Proper-ty, in fact, is but a word: we are 611 owners in fact

but of other men's possessions. Those things only are our

own, which we have sent before us to the other world. Our
