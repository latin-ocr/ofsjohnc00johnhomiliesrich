28 We trent not Christ even as our Frieud.

None of us would fail to relieve a friend who was hunger·
ing, but when Christ comes to us from day to day, and asks
no great matter, but only bread, we do not even regard him,
yea though we are nauseously over full, and swollen with
gluttony3 though our breath betrays the wine of yesterday,
and we live in luxury, and waste our substance on harlots and
parasites and flattererS, and even on monsterS, ideotS, and
dwarfs; for men convert the natural defects of such into matter
for amusement. Again, friends, that are truly such, we do
not envy‚ nor are mortified at their succeSS, yet we feel this
toward (the minister of) Christ, and our friendship for men
is seen to be more powerful than the fear of God, for the
envious and the insincere plainly respect men more than God.
And how is this? God sees the heart, yet man does not for-
bear to practise deceit in His sight3 yet if the same man were
detected in deceit by men, he thinks himself undone, and
blushes for shame. And why speak of this? If a friend be
in distress, we visit him, and should fear to be condemned, if
we deferred it for a little time. But we do not visit Christ,
though He die again and again in prison 3 nay, if we have
friends among the faithful, we visit them, not because they
are Christians, but because they are our friends. Thus we
do nothing from the fear or the love of God, but some things
from friendship, some from custom. When we see a friend
depart on travel, we weep and are troubled, and if we see his
death, we bewail him, though we know that we shall not be
long separated, that he will be restored to us at the Resur-
rection. But though Christ departs from us, or rather we
reject Him daily, we do not grieve‚ nor think it strange, to
injure, to offend, to provoke Him by doing what is displeasing
to Him3 and the fearful thing is not that we do not treat Him
as a friend3 for I will shew that we even treat Him as an
enemy. How, do you ask? because tlte carnal mind is ⁴
eumity ayainst God, as Paul has said, and this we always
carry about us, And we persecute Christ, when He advances
towards uS, and comes to our very doors ⁸. For wicked

actions in effect do this, and every day we subject Him to

8 This idea is beautifully illustrated by the Christusklops of Overbeck.
