‘230 W’ildfaucies of insatiable covelozcsteess.

the fulfilment of his desire3 whatever is bestowed upon him,
he is still unsatisfied, and will therefore never be thankful.
For he will feel no gratitude to him, who does not give him
as much as he wisheS‚ and this no one can ever do, And as
there is no limit to his wisheS, he will feel no gratitude.
Thus no one is so unthankful as the covetOUS, so insensible
as the lover of money. He is the enemy of all the world.
He is indignant that there are men. He would have all one
vast desert, that 116 might have the property of all. And
many wild imaginations does he form. ‘ O that there were
an earthquake, he sayS, in the city, that all the rest being
swallowed up, Ι might be left alone, to have, if possible, the
possessions of all! O that a pestilence would come and
destroy every thing but gold! O that there might be 3 sub-
mersion‚ or an irruption of the sea !' Such are his imagin-
ationS. He prays for nothing good, but for earthquakeS‚ and
thunderboltS, for warS, and plagueS‚ and the like. Well,
tell ine Πονν, thou wretched man, more servile than any
slave, if all things were gold, wouldest thou not be destroyed
by thy gold ⁰, and perish with hunger? If the world were
swallowed up by an earthquake‚ thou also wouldest perish by
thy fatal desire. For if there were no other men than thyself, ἵ
the necessaries of life would fail thee. For suppose that the
other inhabitants of the earth were destroyed at once, and
that their gold and silver came of its own accord to thee.
(For such men fancy to themselves absurditieS‚ and impos-
sibilities.) But if their gold and silver, their vests of silk and
eloth of gold, came into thy hands, what would it profit thee?
Death would only the more certainly overtake thee, when
there were none to prepare bread or till the earth for thee3
wild beasts would prowl around‚ and the devil agitate thy
soul with sear. Many devils indeed now possess it, but then
they would lead thee to desperation‚ and plunge thee at once
into destruction. But you say, ‘ I would wish there should
be tilling of the land and men to prepare food.' Then they
would consume somewhat. ‘ But I would not have them
consume any thing? So insatiable is this desire! For what
can be more ridiculous than this? Seest thou the impossi-

e Al. be parted from thy gold.
