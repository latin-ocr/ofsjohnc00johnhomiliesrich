suffer wrongfully, but avenges them. For this is the part of
one who is just. Π He is powerful, He requites after death,
and at the Resurrection: for this belongs to him who is
powerful. And if because He is long-suffering He bears
with men, let us not be disturbed, nor ask, why He does not
prosecute vengeance here? For if this were done, the whole
human race before this would have been swept away, if
every day He should call us to account for our transgres-
sions‚ since there is not, there is not indeed, a single day
pure from sin, but in something greater or less we offend3
so that we should not one of us have arrived at our twentieth
year, but sor His great long-suffering, and His goodneSS,
that grants us a longer space for repentance, that we may
put off our past transgressionS.

Let each therefore, with an upright conscience, entering
into a review of what he has done, and bringing his whole
life before him, consider, whether he is not deserving of
chastisements and punishments without number? And when
he is indignant that some one, who has been guilty of many
bad actionS, escapes with impunity3 let him consider his
own faultS‚ and his indignation will cease. For those crimes
appear great, because they are in great and notorious matters3
but if he will enquire into his own, he will perhaps find
them more numerous. For to rob and to defraud is the
same thing, whether it be done for gold or silver3 since both ἶ
proceed from the same mind. He that will steal a little
would not refuse to steal much, if it fell in his way3 and that
it does not, is not his own choice, but· an accidental circum-
stance. A poor man, who robs a poorer‚ would not hesitate
to rob the rich if he could. His forbearance arises from
weakness, and not from choice. Such an one, you say, is
a ruler ; and takes away the property of those who are under
his rule. And say, dost not thou steal? For tell me not
that he steals talentS, and you as many¹ pence. In giving
almS, some cast in gold, while the widow threw in two mites,
yet she contributed not less than they. Wherefore? Because
the intention is considered, and not the amount of the gist.
And then, in the case of alms, thou wilt have God judge
