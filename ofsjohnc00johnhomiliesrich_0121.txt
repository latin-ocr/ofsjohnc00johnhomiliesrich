No creature unclean. Meats how sanctified. 95

,, Ver. 4. For every creature (γ’ 6οά is qood, and nothinq Hom.
⁴ ⁷¹⁷ to be refused, if it be received with thanksqiviny. XII.

'³' If it be the creature of God, it is good. For all thirty-5³, it Gen. 1,
3 is said, were very qood. By speaking thus of things eatable‚3¹·
’ 3 116 by anticipation impugns the heresy of those who introduce
ἓ, 311 uncreated matter, and assert that these things proceed
² > from it. But if it is good, why is it sarzctifled by tlte word Qf
’ God andprayers? For it must be unclean, if it is to be
.' sanctified? Not SO, here 116 is speaking to those who
. 1 thought that some of these things were common; therefore
. he lays down two positions: first, that no creature of God is
unclean: secondly, that if it were become s0, you have a
ῑῘ remedy, seal it⁰, give thanks, and glorify God, and all the
’ uncleanness passes away. Can we then so cleanse that which
, is offered to an idol? If you know not that it was so offered.
But if, knowing this, you partake of it, you will be unclean3
ᾖξ’-ζ’ not because it was offered to an idol, but because contrary to
an express command, you thereby communicate with devils.

*f* So that it is not unclean by nature, but becomes so through
your wilful disobedience. What then, is not swine’s fiesh
3⁷ unclean? By no 11163115, when it is received with thanks-
ἰ. giving, and with the seal3 nor is any thing else. It is your
J unthankful disposition to God that is unclean.

1 Ver. 6. If thou put the bretlzren in remembrance Qf these
j thinys, thou skalt be a qood minister quesus- Christ, nourisked
up in tlte words* Qsfaitlz and Qf 90οά doctrine, whereunto thou
kast attained. .

What are the things here meant? The same which he had
21³³ before mentioned, that yreat is tlze mystery5 that to abstain
from meats is the doctrine of devils, that they are cleansed by
the word of Θοά and prayer.

’ἒ Ver. 7. But refuso profane and old wives'fableS, and ea:-
ercise thyseff ratker unco yodlineSS.

'⁹ Puttinq them in remembrance, he says; here you observe
no authority ; but all is condescension: he does not say ‘ com-
manding' or ‘ enj oining,’ but reminding them: that is, suggest
ξ these things as matter of advice, and so enter into discourses
with them concerning the saith, being] nourislzed up, he sayS‚
meaning to imply constancy in application to these thingS.

e i. e. with the sign of the cross, σφςάγισον.
