The discretiori of the blessed Paul is observable. When ‚

he would exhort the Deacons to avoid excess in wine, he

does not say, ⁴ Be not drunken‚’ but not even qiven to much

 

wine. A proper caution3 for if those who served in the ’

if a king intrusts a secret to us. But God has committed
His mystery to uS, yet are we ungrateful to our Benefactor,
as if we had not received the greatest benefits. Our insensi-
bility to such a kindness should strike us with horror. And
how is that a mystery which all know? In the first place all
do not know it, and before then too they knew it not, but now
it is made manifest ἕ.
