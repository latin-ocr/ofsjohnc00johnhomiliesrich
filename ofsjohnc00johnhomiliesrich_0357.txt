 

Trials prolonyed ιγ we are impatient. 3:31

'ff-„the one who was ready to endure any thing, to be beheaded. Hom
ῖξ’ΤῘ]θ othei he caused to be hung up and tortured‚ and that VI

5.- not once or twice, but from city to city. Now why was this
permitted? That he might recover through torments that
quality of mind which he had neglected, that he might shake

off all cowardice, and be no longer afraid to endure any thing.
Joseph t00‚ when he was urgent to escape from prison, was

'left to remain there. For hear him saying‚1ndeed I wasffie Πίέθ,
stolen away out Qf tlte land os tlte Hebrew3; but do thou

 

make mention Qf me to tlze lciny. And for this he was suffeied
ῃ to remain, that he might learn not to place hope or confidence
in men, but to cast all upon God. Knowing these things
’ therefore let us give thanks to God, and let us do all things
⁷ that are expedient for ηε, that we may obtain the good
things to come, through J esus Christ our Lord, with Whom
⁴ to the Father be glory, with the Holy Ghost, now and ever,
ἶ and world without end. Amen.
