they die not for Me, they certainly will die? But He owns Hom.
Himself much indebted to them, because they voluntarily H·
resign that which in the course of nature they were about to
resign shortly against their will. He hath not said, ‘ What
great thing do they, who give away their riches? Even against

their will they will have to surrender them.’ But He owns
Himself much indebted vto them t00, and is not ashamed to
confess before all that He, the Master, is nourished by His
slaves,

For this also is the glory of a Master, to have grateful
slaves. And this is the glory of a Master, that He should thus
love His slaves. And this is the glory of a Master, to claim for
His own what is theirs. And this is the glory of a Master,
not to be ashamed to confess them before all. Let us there-
fore be stricken with awe at this so great love of Christ. Let
us be inflamed with this love-potion. Though a man be low
and mean, yet if we hear that he loves us, we are above all
things warmed with love towards him, and honour him ex-
ceedingly. And do we then love? and when our Master loveth
us so much, are we not excited? Let us not, I beseech you,
let us not be so indifferent with regard to the salvation of our ⁵
souIS, but let us love Him according to our power, and let us
spend all upon His love, our life, our riches, our glory, every
thing, with delight, with joy, with alacrity, not as rendering
any thing to Him, but to ourselves. For such is the law of
those who love. They think that they are receiving favourS,
when they are suffering wrong for the sake of their beloved.
Therefore let us be so affected towards our Lord, that we?
{also may partake of the good things to come in Christ J esus
