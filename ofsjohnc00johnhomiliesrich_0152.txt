is bright and round on all sideS, another has some different
beauty. And how is this? As coral haS‚ by a kind of art,
its line extended, and its angles shaped off, and another eolour
more delicious than white, and the prasius above every
green, another has the rich colour of blood, another an azure
surpassing the sea, another is more brilliant than the purple,

would any one that was but an ordinary man have said?
Would it not be, ‘ Who is this that perpetrates such acts?
Would he not have accused him of cruelty and brutality?
