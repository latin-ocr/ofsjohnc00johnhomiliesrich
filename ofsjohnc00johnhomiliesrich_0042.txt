having before his eyes rather the condemnation of conscience
than the punishment hereafter. Moreover he calls him a righte-

’ ous man, who has attained unto virtue, He therefore uses the

law lawfully, who does not require to be instructed by it.
For as points in reading are set before children ; but he who
does what they direct, without their aid, from other knowledge,
shews more skill, and is a better reade1·; so he who is above
the law, is not under the schooling of the law, For he keeps
it in a much higher degree, who fulfils it not from fear, but
from a virtuous inclination3 since he that fears punishment
does not fulfil it in the same manner as he that aims at re-
ward. He that is under the law doth it not as he that is
above the law. For to live above the law is to use it law-
sully. He uses it lawfully, and keeps it, who achieves things
beyond the laW, and who does not need its instructions. For
the law, for the most part, is prohibition of evi13 now this
alone does not make a man righteOUS, but the performance
of good actions besides. Hence those, who abstain from evil
like slaveS, do not come up to the mark of the law, For it
was appointed for the punishment of transgression. Such
men indeed use it, but it is to dread its punishment. It is
said, Wict thou not be afra-id of the power ,9 do that which is

qood .· which implies, that the law threatens punishment „only to

the wicked. But of what use is the law to him whose actions
deserve a crown? as the surgeon is of use only to him who
hath some hurt, and not to the sound and healthy man.
But for the lawless and disobedient,for tlee zmyodly andfor
sirmers‘. He calls the Jews lawless and disobedient τοο. T he
law (he says) worketlc wrath, that is, to the evil doers. But
what to him who is deserving of reward? By the law is the
knowledye of sin. What then with respect to* the righteous?
the law is not made, he says,f0r a riyhteous man Where-
sore? Because he is exempted from its punishment, and he
waits not to learn from it what is his duty, since he has the
grace of the Spirit within to direct him. For the law was
given, that men might be chastened by sear of its threatenings. ¹
