22⁶2 All else is vain without mercy.

222'f31315 Seest thou that a failure in almsgiving is enough to cast a
lvlonuz: man into hell fire? For where will he avail who does not give
alms? Dost thou fast every day? So also did those virginS,
but it availed them nothing. Dost thou pray? What of that?
prayer without almsgiving is unfruitful, without that all things
are unclean and unprofitable. The better part of virtue is

ἐ ‹5801111 destroyed. He that loveth not leis brother, it is said, know-
' ⁹ eth not God. And how dost thou love him, when thou dost

not even impart to him of these poor worthless things? Tell
me, therefore, dost thou observe chastity ? On what account?
From fear of punishment? By no means. It is of a natural
endowment that thou observest it, since if thou wast chaste
from fear of punishment, and didst violence to nature in sub-
mitting to so severe a rule, much more oughtest thou to do
alins. For to govern the desire of wealth, and of bodily plea-
sureS, is not the same thing. The latter is much more diffi-
cult to restrain. And wherefore? Because the pleasure is
natural, and the desire of it is innate and of natural growth
in the body. It is not so with riches. Herein we are able
to resemble God, in shewing mercy and pity. When there-
fore we have not this quality, we are devoid of all good. He
has not said, ‘ ye shall be like uuto your Father, if ye fast,' ³
nor ‘if ye be virgins,' nor ⁶ if ye pray,' hath He said, ‘ ye
shall be like unto your father,’ for none of these things
can be applied to God, nor are they His acts. But
¹Luke 6, what? Be με meo'cfful, as your Father in Heaven εἷς merc-{sub
ὅδ’ This is the work of God. If therefore thou hast not this,
Roseae, what hast thou? He says: J wilc have mercy, and not sacri-

these, and worthy of His wisdom! But by none of these
has He so powerfully attracted human nature to Himself,
as by mercy and the love of mankind. For that indeed
is the work of power and wisdom and goodness. But
it is far more so that He became a servant. Do we not
for this more especially adrnire Him? are we not for this
still more amazed at Him? Nothing attracts God to us so
much as mercy. And the prophets from beginning to end
discourse upon this subject. But I speak not of mercy
that is accompanied with covetousness. That is not mercy.
For it is not the root of the thorn but of the olive that produces
