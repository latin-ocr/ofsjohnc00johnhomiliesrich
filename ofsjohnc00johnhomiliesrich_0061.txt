For a thing must either be destructible, or altogether in- Hom·
destruetible. Are we men then immortal even as He? IV.
God forbid ἔ Surely not! Why? because He has it by nature,

but We adventitiously. Why then do you make the differ-
ence? Because the Father, he sayS, is made such as He is

by no other: but the Son is what He is, from the Father.
This we also confess, not denying that the Son is generated
from the Father incorruptibly0. And we glorify the Father,

he meanS, for having generated the Son, such as He is, Thus

> you see the Father is most glorified, when the Son hath done
great things, For the glory of the Son is referred again to
Him. And since He generated Him omnipotent and such

as He is in Himself, it is notf more the glory of the Son
than of the Father‚ that He is sels-sufficient, and sels-main-
tained, and free from infirmity. It has been said of the Son,

By whom He made the worlds. Now there is a distinction Heb. 1,
observed among us between creation and workmanship g. 2·
For one works and toils and executeS, another rules3 and
why? because he that executes is the inferior. But it is not

so there3 nor is the sovereignty with One, the workrnan—
ship with the Other. For when we hear, By whom He
made the worlds ¹¹, we do not exclude the Father from creation.

Nor when we say, To the Kiny immortal ἱ, do we deny domi-
nion to the Son. For these are common to the One and the
Other, and each belongs to Both. The Father created, in

that He begat the creating Son, the Son ruleS, as being Lord

of all things created. For He does not work for hire, nor in
obedience to otherS, as workmen do among ηε, but from His own
goodness and love for mankind. But has the Son ¹‘ ever been
seen? No one can affirm this, What means then, To the Kiny
immortal, invisible, the only wise¹ God ,9 Or when it is said,
There is no other name whereby we must be saved: and Acts 4,
again, There is salvation in no other? η’
