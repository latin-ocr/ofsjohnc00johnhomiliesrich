Seeminyly sudden effects after lony labour. 215

³ when we have come to the very gates of Hell, the vestibule Hom.
of wickedness itself, it may be possible to recover, to renew V.

yet they gained something, and afterwards shewed all at once
abundant fruit. For as a tree may receive ten strokes, and
not fall; then afterwards be brought down all at once by a
single blow: yet it is not done by that one blovv, but by the
ten which made that last successful. And this is known to
him who sees the root, though he who takes his view of the
trunk above knows it not. So it is in this case. And thus
often, when physicians have applied many remedieS, no
benefit is perceived3 but afterwards some one comes in and
effects an entire cure. Yet it is not the work of him alone,

that, if now we do not bring forth the fruits of hearing the
word, yet hereafter we shall. For that we shall bring them
forth, I am fully persuaded. For it is not, indeed it is not
possible'that such eager desire, such a love of hearing, should
fail of its effect. God forbid ἔ But may we all, having become
worthy of the admonitions of Christ, obtain the everlasting

blessingS, 8ῑο-
