THE favours of God so far exceed human hope and
expectation, that often they are not believed. For God has
bestowed upon us such things as the mind of man never looked
for, never thought of. It is for this reason that the Apostles
spend much discourse in securing a belief of the gifts that
are granted us of God. For as men, upon receiving some
great good, ask themselves if it is not a dream, as not be-
lieving it3 so it is with respect to the gists of God. What
then was it that was thought incredible? That those who
were enemies‚ and sinnerS, neither justified by the law, nor
by workS‚ should immediately through saith alone be ad-
vanced to the highest favour. Upon this head accordingly
Paul has discoursed at length in his Epistle to the RomanS,
and here again at length. This is a faithful sayiuq, he sayS,
and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into
the world to save sinuerS.

As the Jews were chiefly attracted by this, he persuades
thern not⁸to give heed to the law, since they could not attain

ὃ SaV. omits ⁴ not3' so the sense will would prove that men could not be
be, that adue consideration of the Law saved by it.
