Tuus loved both by God and men3 and not only by virtuous men,

2, ยน6โถ but by the wicked3 nay by them more especially, for they
more especially honour and respect virtue. For as those who
are under rule stand most in awe of the meek, so do the
vicious most revere the virtuous, knowing from what they
themselves have fallen. Since such then is the fruit of virtue,
this let us pursue, and attain. If we adhere to this, nothing
will be formidable, but all things easy and manageable. And
though we pass through the fire and through the water, all
things yielcl to virtue, even death itself. Let us then be
zealous in the pursuit of it, that we may attain the good things
to come, in Jesus Christ our Lord, with Whom, &Q
