1 Tm. God takes these things from US, that he may lead us to heaven.
1, If you ask then why He permits the wicked to be rich, it is
because they are not high in His esteem. And if the righ-
teous too are (rich, it is rather that He allows it to be, than
that He makes them so. Now these things we say superfi-
oially, as to men not knowing the Scriptures. But our dis-
courses would be unneoessary if you would believe and take
heed to the divine word, for that would teaoh you all things.
And that you may understand that neither riches, nor health,
nor glory, are any thing, I ean shew you many, wh0‚ when
they might gain wealth, do not seek wealth3 when they might
enjoy health‚ mortify their bodies 3 when they might rise to
glory, make it their aim to be despised. But there is no good
man, who ever studies to be bad. Let us therefore desist

from seeking things below, and let us seek heavenly things3 .
for so we shall be able to attain them, and we shall enjoy
eternal delightsq, by the grace and loving-kindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ. To Whom with the F ather and the Holy
Ghost be glory, power, and honour, nOW‚ and ever, and world

without end. Amen.
