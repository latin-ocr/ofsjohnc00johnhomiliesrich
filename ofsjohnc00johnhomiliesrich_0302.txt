TITUS This also is a command. But when He sayS, ff thou wilt
Mlgtss' be peffect, 90 and sell all tlzat thou least: and, He that is
19, 21. able to receive it, let kim receive it: this is not a command, '⁴

{gatg- for He makes His hearer the disposer of the matter, and leaves
⁷ him the choice, whether he will do it or not. For these
things we may either do or not do. But commandments are
not left to our choice, we must either perform them, or be
punished for not doing so. This is implied when he says,
lCor· 9, Necessity is laid upon me ,· yea woe is unte me, ff I preack
1⁶· not the αοερεῑ. This I wiu state more plainly, that it may
be manifest to all. For instance, He that is intrusted with ²
the govermnent of the Church, and honoured with the office ᾳ
osa Bishop, if he does not declare to the people what they ²
ought to do, will have to answer for it. But the layman is
under no such obligation. On this account Paul also sayS,
Accordiny to the commandment os God our Saviour, I do
this. And see how the epithets fit in to what I have said.

For having said above, God who cannot lie, here he says,
Accordiny to tlze commandment of God our Saviour. If ⁵
then He is our Saviour, and He commanded these things
with a view that we should be saved, it is not from a love of
command. It is a matter of saith, and the commandment of „
God our Saviour.

possible for men not to be true sonS, as he of whom he sayS,
lcor.5,If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or Ῐ
11. covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or α drmzlcard, with ἶ
² ‘timo’ such an one no not to eat. Here is a son ², but not a true ,
son.‘ A son indeed he is, because hc has once received the ¹
grace, and has been regenerated: but he is not a true son, Ἴ
because he is unworthy of his F ather, and a deserter to the ,-
usurped sovereignty of another. For in children by nature,
the true and the spurious are determined by the father that
begot, and the mother who bore them. But it is not so in ’
this case, but it depends on the disposition. For one who
was a true son may become spuriouS, and a spurious son
may become a true one. For it is not the force of nature,
but the power of choice, on which it dependS, whence it is
subject to frequent changes. Onesimus was a true son, but ὅ
1ιο was again not true, for he became unprofitable ; ⁴ then he ’
