2 Tim. i. 13—18.

Holdsast the form ofsound words, which thou hast heard os
me, in saith and love which is in Christ Jesus. That
qood thinq which was committed unio thee keep by the
Holy G'host Which dwelleth in us. This thou knowest,
that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me,·
of whom are Phyyellus and Hermoqerees. The Lord
yive morey unto the house of Onesiphorus ; for he oft
refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain : but
when he was in Rome, he souyht me out very diliyently,
and found me. The Lord ¹qramt anto him that he may
find mer-cy of the Lord in that day: and in how many
thinys he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very
well.

⁴ 2 Tim. ii. 1—7.

Thou therefore, my son, be stronq in- the φησι) that is in
Christ Jesas. And the thinqs that thou hast heard of me
amonsy many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful
men, who shall be able to teaoh others also· Thou there-
fore endure hardness, as a qood soldier of Jesus Christ.
No man that warreth entanqleth himself with the affairs
of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him
to be a soldier. And if a man also strive for masteries,
yet ishe not orowned, except he strive lawfully. The
husbandmcm that laboureth. must be first partaker of the
fruits. Consider what I say ; and the Lord yive thee
understandiny in all thinys.
