 

Despisers of their bretlcren despise God. 229

Γ servantS, is more meek to his Master. He that despises his Hom.
ᾗ fellow-servantS, will end with despising God Himself. Let MYuH·
ἶ us not then despise one another, for that is an evil training ‘AL'
which teaches us to despise God. And indeed to despise
one another is in effect to despise God, Who commanded us
to shew all regard to one another. And this may be other-
wise manifested by an example. Cain despised his brother,
and SO, immediately after, he despised God. How despised
Him? Mark his insolent answer to G·od; Am I my brother’s Gen. 4,
keeper? Again, Esau despised his brother, and he too de-9’
spised God. Wherefore God said, Jacob have I lovecl, but1R30m· 9,
’ Esau have· I hated. Hence Paul sayS‚ Lest there be any Mati,
fornicator or profane person as Esau. T he brethren of {I 3212,
Joseph despised him, and they also despised God. The 16.
Israelites despised MoseS, and they also despised God. So
too the sons of Eli despised the people, and they too despised
God. Would you see it also from the contrary? Abraham,
who was tender of his brother’s son, was obedient to God, as
is manifest in his conduct with respect to his son Isaac, and
in all his other virtues. Again, Abel was meek to his brother,
and he a-lso was pious towards God. Let us not therefore
despise one another, lest we leam also to despise God. Let
us honour one another, that we may learn also to honour
God. He that is insolent with respect to men, will also be
insolent with respect to God. But when covetousness and
selfishness and insolence meet together, what is wanting tov
complete destruction? Every thing is corrupted, and a foul
flood of sins bursts in. thlcanlcful, he says. For how can
the covetous man be thankful? To whom will he feel grati-
tude? Toqno one. He considers all men his enemies, and
desires the goods of all. Though you spend your whole
substance upon him, he will feel no gratitude. He is angry
that you have not more, that you might bestow it upon him.
And if you made him master of the whole world, he would
still be unthanksul, and think that he had received nothing.
This desire is insatiable. It is the craving of disease3 and
such is thenature of the cravings of disease.

He who has a fever can never be satisfied‚ but with (2)
constant desire of drinking, is never filled, but suffers a
continual thirst3 so he who is mad after wealth never knows
