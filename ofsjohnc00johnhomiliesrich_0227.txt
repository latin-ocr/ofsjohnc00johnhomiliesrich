True Glory Nero compared with St. Paul. 201

they are but on earth. Present things are ignominiOUS, but Hom.
’ they are temporary. They are full of bitterness and pain31V'
’ but they last only to-day and to-morrow.

Such is not the nature of the good things, they are eternal, (3)
they are in heaven. That is truly glory, this is dishonour.
For observe, I pray, beloved‚ that is not glory which is on Monam.
earth, the true glory is in heaven. But if any one would be
glorified‚ let him be dishonoured. If he would obtain rest,
let him suffer affiiction. If any one would be for ever illus-
triouS, would enjoy pleasure, let him despise temporal things.
And that dishonour is glory, and glory dishonour, let us now
set before us to the best of our power, that we may see what
is real glory. It is not possible to be glorified upon earth 3
if thou wouldest be glorified, it must be through dishonour.
And let usprove this in the examples of two personS, Nero
and Paul. The one had the glory of this world, the other
the dishonour. How? The first was a tyrant, had obtained
great succeSS, had raised many trophieS, had wealth ever
flowing in, numerous armies every where, he had the greater
part of the world and the imperial city subject to his sway,
the whole senate crouching to him, and his palace toof was
advancing with splendid show. When he must be armed, he
went forth arrayed in gold and precious stones. When he was
to sit still in peace, he sat clothed in robes of purple. He was
surrounded by numerous guards and attendants, He was
called Lord of land and sea, Emperor', Augustus, Caesar,¹Afae‹
King, and other such high sounding names as implied r ”e‘m’e
flattery and courtship3 and nothing was wanting that might
tend to glory. Even wise men and potentates and sovereigns
trembled at him. For beside all this, he was said to be a
crue] and violent man. He even wished to be thought a
god, and he despised both all the mols, and the very God
Who is over all. He was worshipped as a god. What
greater glory than this? Or rather what greater disho-
nour? For--l know not how—my tongue is carried away
by the force of truth, and passes sentence before judgment.
Meanwhile let us examine the matter according to the opinion
