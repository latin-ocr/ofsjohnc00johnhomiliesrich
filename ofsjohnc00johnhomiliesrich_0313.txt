Teacher, if thou art unequal to the dignity of the office 3 but
though dragged to it, decline it.' Dost thou see that the

For there is nothing which is not spoiled by these passionS. (3)
But as when violent winds, falling on a calm sea, turn it up MORAL·

the man is, and thou wilt see how ridiculous a thing is glory,
that it is rather to be called shame.
