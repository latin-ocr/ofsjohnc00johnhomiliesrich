2 Tm. There be thou violent! be grasping! It is not diminished by

-4-’3-23- being seized upon. For neither is virtue divided, nor piety
lessened, nor the kingdom of Heaven. Virtue is increased
when thou seizest upon it, whilst tempora] goods are lessened
when they are seized upon. And this appears from hence:
Let there be ten thousand men in a city3 if all seize on
