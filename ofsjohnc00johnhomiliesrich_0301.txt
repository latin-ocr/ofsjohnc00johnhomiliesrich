J That is, the preaching is committed unto me. For this
³⁰. included every thing, the Gospel, and things present, and
³J³ things future, life, and godlineSS, and saith, and all things at
{f once. Tltrouqh preat-hino, that 18, openly and with all bold-
neSS, for this is the‘ meaning of preat-hino. For as a herald
proclaimsd in the theatre in the presence of all, so also we
¹ preach‚ adding nothing, but declaring the things which
we have heard. For the excellence of a herald consists in
J proclaiming to all what has really happened, not 111 adding
or taking 'away any thing. If therefore it is necessary to
preach, it is necessary to do it with boldness of speech.
Otherwise, it is not preaching. On this account Christ did
not say, Tell it upon the housetopS, but preaolz upon the Matt
housetops; shewing both by the place and by the manner10227·
'what was to be done.

Which is committed mato me accordiny to the command-

ment of God our Saviour.

1116 commandment, shew the matter to be worthy of credit,

 

   

so that no one should think it discreditable, nor be hesi-
tating about it, or discontented. If thenit is a command-
ment, it is not at my disposal. I fulfil what is commanded.
For of things to be done, some are in our power, others
are not. For what He commandS, that 18 1101 111 our
power, what He permitS, is left to our choice. For in-
stance, Wltosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool‚ Matt. 5,
shall be in danyer of hell fire. This 18 6 commandment.2
J And again, If thou brino thy yift to the altar, and there Matt 5,
rememberest that tlzy brother laath. ouykt aqam-st thee, leave 23 ²4
there thy §.ist before tlte altar, and 90 thy way; first be
reconciled to thy brother, and then come and (ὢν thy qist.
