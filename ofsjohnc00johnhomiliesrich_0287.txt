St. Paul, when deserted by men, supported by God. 261

him, which is a prophecy rather than an imprecation. And X.
that 116 says these things to prepare the mind of his disciple‚

is manifest also from what follows. But see how he mentions
other of his trials.

Ver. 16. At my first answer‚ he sayS, no man stood with
me, but all men forsook me: I prag] God that it may not be
laid to their charye.

Do you see how he sparos his friends, notwithstanding it (2)
was a grievous thing they had done? For it is not the same
thing to be despised by aliens, as by our own friends. Do
you see his intense dejectiori? It cannot be said, that I was
assailed by those without, but had comfort 111 the attention
and support of my friends3 for these also betrayed me.
’ All men, he sayS‚ forsoolc me. And this was no light offence.

He does not say He strengthened me as deserving of His
gift, but that the preachinffi with which 1 was entrusted,
miqloet befully known. As if any one should wear a purple
robe and a diadem, and to that circumstance should owe
his sasety.

And that all the Gentiles miqlet hear.

What is this ? That the lustre of the Gospel, and the care
of His Providence for me, might be known to all.
