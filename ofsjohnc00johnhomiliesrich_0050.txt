that they may not let it fall into the hands of the enemy3 so

,those 'who sustain the name of Christ, not only in war but in

peace, need a mighty strength, to preserve it uninjured from
the attacks of accuserS. Great indeed is the strength required
to bear the name of Christ, and to sustain it well, and bear
the Cross. For he who in action, or word, or thought, does
any thing unworthy of Christ, does not sustain His name,
and has not Christ dwelling in him. For he that sustains
that name bears it in triumph, not in the concourse of men,
but through the very heavens, while all 'angels stand in awe,
and attend upon him, and admire him.

J manle the Lord, who Izath enabled me. Observe how
he thanks God even for that which was his own part. For
he acknowlcdges it as a favour from Him that he was a chosen
ves-sel. For this, O blessed Paul, was thy own part. For
God is no respecter of persons ὓ. But I thank Him that he
tlaouqht me worthy of this ministry. For this is a proof
that He esteemed me faithful. The steward in a house is
not only thankful to his master that he is trusted, but con-
siders it as a sign that he holds him more faithful than others:
so it is here. Then observe how he magnifies the mercy and
lovingkindness of God, in describing his former life, who
was formerly, he says, a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and
injurians. And when he speaks of the still unbelieving
J eWS, he rather extenuates their guilt. For I bear them
record that they havea zeal for God, but not aecor-dim to
knowledye. But of himself he says, VVlzo was a blasphemer
and a persecutor. Observe his lowering of himself! So free
was he from self-love, so full of humility, that he is not
satisfied to call himself a persecutor and a blasphemer, but
he aggravates his guilt, shewing· that it did not stop with
himself, that it was not enough that he was a blasphemer,
but in the madness of his blasphemy he persecuted those
who were willing to be godlyc.
