Deadsaz'th. Deeez't works on women. 239

when we admire a painting‚ we say that it speakS, that it
breathes. But we do not mean to express the same thing,
but in one case to mark likeness, in the other beauty. So
here with respect to form, in the one passage, it means a
model, or representation, a doctrine, or pattern of godliness3
in the other, something that is lifeless, a mere appearance,
shew, and hypocrisy. Faith therefore, without works, is
'fitly called a mere form without the power. For as a fair
and florid body, when it has no strength, is like a painted
figure, so is a right faith apart from works. For let us
suppose any one to be coo-etone, a traitor, heady, and yet to
believe aright3 of what advantage is it, if he wants all the
qualities becoming a Christian, if he does not the works that
characterize godlineSS, but outdoes the Greeks in impiety,
when he ³vis a mischief to those with whom he associateS,
causes God to be blasphemed, and the doctrine to be
slandered by his evil deeds?

From such turn away, he says. But how is this, if men
are to be so in the latter times ‚2 There were probably then
such, in some degree at least, though not to the same excess.
But, in truth, through him he warns all to turn away from
such characters.

deceiver, the weapons which the devil used against Adam?
Enteri‘nq into houseS, he says. Observe how he shews their
impudence by this expression ⁸, their dishonourable wayS,
their deceitfulness. Leadireq captive silly women, so that he
who is easy to be deceived is a silly woman, and nothing
like a man: for to be deceived is the part of silly women.
Laden with sins. See whence arises their persuasion, fr‘om
their sins, from their being conscious to themselves of nothing
