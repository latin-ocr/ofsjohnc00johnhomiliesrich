134 Careful enquiry and decisive censure.

Ver. ΞΟ. leem that sin rebuke before all, that others also
may sear.

Do not, he sayS, hastily cut them off, but carefully inquire
into all the circumstanceS, and when thou hast thoroughly
informed thyself, then proceed against the offender with
rigour, that others may take warning. For as it is wrong to
condemn hastily and rashly, so not to punish manifest
offences is to open the way to otherS, and embolden them to
offend.

Rebulce, he sayS, to shew that it is not to be done lightly,
but with severity. For thus others will be deterred. How
is it then that Christ says, ΘΟ and tell him his fault be·
tween him and thee alone, {f one sin ayainst thee. But
Christ Himself permits him to be censured in the Church.
What then? is it not a greater scandal, that one should be
rebuked before all? How so? For it is a much greater*
scandal‚ that the offence should be known, and not the
punishment. For as when sinners go unpunished‚ many
commit crimes3 so when they are punished, many are made
better. God Himself acted in this manner. He brought
forth Pharaoh, and punished him openly. And Nebu-
chadnezzar too, and many others, both cities and individuals, ·
we see visited with punishment. Paul therefore would have
all stand in awe of their Bishop, and sets him over all.

And because many judgments are formed upon suspicion,
there ought, he sayS‚ to be witnesses, and men to convict the
offender according to the ancient law. At tlte mouth qs two
er three witnesses shall every matter be established.-—A9ain8t
an elder receive not an accusation. He does not say, ‘ do
not condemn,‘ but receive not an accusation, bring him not
to judgment at all. But what if the two witnesses are false?
This rarely happenS, and it may be discovered upon examin·
ation on the trial. For since offences are committed in
secret, we ought to be satisfied with two witnesses, and this
is sufficient proof of investigation.

But what if the offences be notoriouS, and yet there are no
witnesseS, only a strong suspicion? It has been said above
that he ought to have a qood repert Qf them which are witk-
out.

Let us therefore love God with sear. The law indeed is
