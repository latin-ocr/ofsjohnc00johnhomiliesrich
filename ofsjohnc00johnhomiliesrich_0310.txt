Haviny faithful children, not accused Qf riot, or unruly.
We should observe what care he bestows upon children. ,
For he who cannot be the instructor of his own children, how l
should he be the Teacher of others ? If he cannot keep in ς
order those whom he has had with him from the beginning, 1
whom he has brought up, and over whom he had power both j
by the laws, and by nature, how will he be able to benefit 1,
111086 without? For if the incompetency of the father had 7
not been great, he would not have allowed those to become
bad whom from the first he had under his power. For it is ’
1101 possible, indeed it is not, that one should turn out ill who
is brought up with much care, and has received great atten- >
tion. Sins are not so prevalent by nature, as to overcome
so much previous care. But if, occupied in the pursuit of 1
wealth, he has made his children a secondary concern, and
not bestowed much care upon them, even so he is unworthy.
For if when nature prompted, he was so void of affection or ’
so 8611861688, 11131 116 thought more of his wealth than of his
children, how should 116 be raised to the Episcopal throne, ³
and so great rule? For if he was unable to restrain them, it s
is a great proof of his weakness 3 and if he was unconcerned, '
his want of affection is much to be blamed. He then that J
neglects his own children, how shall he take care of other ¹
men's? And he has not only said, not riotouS, but not even ,
accused of riot. There must not be an ill report, or such an -
opinion of them. ᾗ
Ver. 7. For α Bishop must be blameZeSS, as the steward of ’
God ‚· not sels-willeri, not soon anyry, not yiven to wine, no ·
striker.
For a ruler without, as he rules by law and compulsion, <-
perhaps does not consult the wishes of those under his rule. ·
But he who ought to rule men with their own consent, and
who will be thankful for his rule, if he so conduct himself as ·
to do every thing of his own will, and share counsels with no
one, makes his presidency tyrannical rather than popular. ’
