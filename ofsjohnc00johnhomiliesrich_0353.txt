who received their alms. For if their concern had only been HOM-
that the poor might by any means be relieved‚ they would VI
Ι not have judged so severely of the sin of Ananias and Sap-
’ phira, when they kept back their money. Nor would Paul
have charged men to give not yrudqinqu nor of necessity. 2Cor. 9,
What sayest thou, Paul? dost thou discourage giving to the7‘
poor? No, he answers3 but I consider not their advantage
only, but the good of those who give. Dost thou see, that
when the prophet gave that excellent counsel to Nebuchad-
nezzar, he did not merely consider the poor. For he does
not content himself with saying, Give to the poor3 but what?
Brealc off thy sins by almsdeedsss, and illine iniquitzes by Dan. 4,
skewiny merc-y to tlte poor. Part with thy wealth, not that ²⁶⁷
others may be fed, but that thou mayest escape punishment.
And Christ again says, Go and secl that thou least, and yive Μ att
to the poor ..... and come andsollow Me. Dost thou see 19' 2¹⁵
·’ that the commandment was given that he might be induced
s to follow Him? For as riches are an impediment, therefore
he commands them to be given to the poor, instructing the
Α soul to be pitifuland mercisul, to despise wealth‚ and to fiee
from covetousneSS. For he who has learnt to give to him
ἶ that needs, will in time learn not to receive from those who
¹ have to give. This makes men like God. Yet virginity, and
fasting, and lying on the ground, are more difficult than this,
but nothing is so strong and powerful to extinguish the fire
of our sins as almsgiving. It is greater than all other virtues.
It places the lovers of it by the side of the King Himself, and
justly. For the effect of virginity‚ of fasting, of lying on the
ground, is confined to those who practise them, and no other
is saved thereby. But almsgiving extends to all, and em..
braces the members of Christ, and actions that extend their
effects to many are far greater than those which are confined
-to one. ⁴
. For almsgiving is the mother of love, of that love, which (3)
is the characteristic of Christianity, which is greater than all
miracles, by which the disciples of Christ are manifested. lt
is the medicine of our sinS, the cleansing of the filth of our
souls, the ladder fixed to heaven3 it binds together the body
