Peace qfllce world qood if usedfor Godliness. 55

an end3 whoever does not still this tumult, must fall pierced by HOM-
wounds that will bring that death that is in hell. We have VII.
daily need therefore of care and great anxiety, that this war

 

may not be stirred up within US, or that, if stirred up, it may
not last, but be quelled and laid asleep. For what advantage
is it, that the world enjoys profound peace, if thou art at war
with thyself? This then is the peace we should keep. If ἡ
we have it, nothing from without will be able to harm us.
And to this end the public peace contributes no little: whence
it is said, Tkat we may lead a quiet and peaceable li e.
But if any one is disturbed when there is quiet, he is a mise-
rable creature. Seest thou that He speaks of this peace
which I call the third kind? Therefore when he has said,
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable li e, he does not stop
there, but adds, in all yodlz’ness and leones-ty. But we cannot
live in godliness and honesty, unless that peace be established.
For when curious reasonings disturb our saith, what peace is
there? or when spirits of uncleanness, what peace is there?

For that we may not suppose that he speaks of that sort of
life which all men live, when he says, that we may lead a
quiet andpeaceable life, he adds, in all qodliness and laone-Sty,
since a quiet and peaceable life may be led by heathens, and
profligateS, and voluptuous and wauton persons may be found
living such a life. That this cannot be meant, is plain, from
what he adds, in all yodliness and konesty. Such a life is ex-
posed to snareS, and conflicts, and the soul is daily wounded by
thetumults of its own thoughts. But what sort of life he really
means is plain from the sequel, and plain too, in that he speaks
not simply of godlineSS, but adds, of all yodlz‘ness. For in
saying this he seems to insist on a godliness not only of doc-
, trine, but such as is supported by life, for in both surely
must godliness be required. For of what advantage is it to
be godly as to doctrine, but ungodly in life? and that it is
very possible to be ungodly in life, hear this same blessed
Apostle saying elsewhere, They profess tlzat they know God, Titus 1,
but in works they dewy Him. And again, He laath denied tlze i671'im.
