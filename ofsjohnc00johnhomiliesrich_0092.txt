66 Dis-play of Viryins adultery ayaz'nst Christ.

{TI M· winding the hood entirely round the head. Then like the
,.76 playerS, they wear gloves so closely fitted, that they seem to
giow upon the hands: and we might speak of their welk, ·
and other artifices more alluring than any ornaments of gold.
Let us sear, beloved, lest we also hear what the Prophet said
to the Hebrew women who were so studious of outward orna-
Is.3,24. ment3 Instead of a qirdle, thou skalt be qirded with a
LXX. baller, instead of well-set hair, hammes-5. These things and
many others, invented only to be seen and to attract beholders,
are more alluring than golden ornaments. These are no
trifling faults, but displeasing to God, and enough to mar all

the sels-denial os virginity.
(3) Thou hast Christ for thy Bridegroom, Ο virgin, why dost
thou seek to attract human lovers? He will judge thee as

 

an adulteress. Why dost thou not wear the ornament that is
pleasing to Him3 modesty, chastity, ordei-lineSS, and sober
apparel? This is meretricious, and disgraceful. We can no

all his care upon the interior. Say not, ‘ Alas! I wear a thread-
bare garment, mean shoeS‚ a worthless veil; what is there of
ornament in these ?’ Do not deceive thyself. It is possible,
as I said, to study appearance more by these than by
costlier dresses3 especially when they are close-fitted to the
body, fashioned to an immodest sheW, and of shining

fflfssggd, thou say to God, Who knows the heart and the spirit with
ing.) which thou doest these things? ‘ It is not done for for-
nication!' Perhaps not, but for admiration3 and dost thou
not blush for shame to be admired for such things? But
thou sayest‚ ⁶ It is but chance I am so dressed, and sor no mo-
tive of this kind? Go'd knoweth what thou sayest to me: is

it to me thou must give account? Nay, it is to Him Who is ⁷
