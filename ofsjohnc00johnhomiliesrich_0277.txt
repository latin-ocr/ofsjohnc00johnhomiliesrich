Reproof to be tempered with eoehortation. 251

ᾗ ing that he had reminded Him of that appearing. Then Hom.
l teaching him how he ought to preach the word,4he adds, lx.
y Ver. 2. Preach the word: be instant in geaeon, out of
l season; reprove, rebulce, exhort with all lonysufferiny and
l doctrine.

l What means in season, out of season? That is, have not
l ι any limited season: let it always be thy season, not only in
³ peace and security, and when sitting in the Church.
Ἴ Whether thou be in danger, in prison, in chains, or going to
= thy death, at that very time reprove. Withhold not rebuke,
ἦ for reproof is then most seasonable‚ when thy rebuke will be
= most successful, when the reality is proved. ’ Exhort, he
η says, After the manner of physicianS, having shewn the
wound, he gives the incision, he applies the plaister. For if
you omit either of these, the other becomes useless If you
rebuke without convicting, you will seem to be rash, and no
one will tolerate it, but after the matter is proved, he will
submit to rebuke: before, he will be headstrong. And if
you convict and rebuke, but vehemently, and do not apply
exhortation ³, all your labour will be lost. For convictionb
is intolerable in itself, if consolation be not mingled with it.
As if incision, though salutary in itself, have not plenty of
lenitives to assuage the pain, the patient cannot endure cutting
and hacking, so it is in this matter.

With all lonqsufferiny and doctrine. For he that reproves
is required to be longsuffering, that he 'may not believe
hastily, and rebuke needs consolation, that it may be
received as it ought. And why to lonysufferiny does he
add doctrine? ‘ Not as in anger, not as in hatred, not as
insulting over him, not as having caught an enemy. Far be
these things from thee.’ But how? As loving, as sympa-
thizing with him, as more distressed than himself at his giief,
as melted at his sufferings? With. all lonqsufferinq and
doctrine. No ordinary teaching is implied.

Ver. 3. For tlte time will come when they will not endure
sound doctrine.

Before they grovv stiffnecked⁸, preoccupy them all. For

ὃ Or comfort. c See on Stat. Hom. xii. Tr. p. 207,
