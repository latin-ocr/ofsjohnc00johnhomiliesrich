Culpable iynorance. Lawful use of the Lam. 15

Nay, and their very ignorance arose from these causes. For HGM-
when the soul abandons itself to carnal thingS, the clearness ”
of its vision is dimmed, and falling from love, it drops into
contentiousneSS, and the eye of the mind is blinded. For he
that is possessed by any desire for these temporal thingS, in-
toxicated, as he is, with passion, cannot be an impartial judge
of truth ⁶.

Not knowinq wherecff they affirm.

For it is probable that they spoke of the laW, and enlarged
on its purifications and other bodily rites. The Apostle then
forbearing to censure these, as either nothing, or at best a
shadow and figure of spiritual things, proceeds in a more
engaging way to praise the law, calling the Decalogue here
the laW, and by means of it discarding the rest. For if even
these precepts punish transgressors‚ and become useless to
US, much'more the others,

Ver. 8, 9. But we know that the law is qood, if a man

What then? if one use it not lawfully, is it not good?
Nay, even so it is good. But what he means is this3 if
,- any one fulfils it in his actions; for that is to use it
. lawfully, as here intended. But when they expound it in
their words, and neglect> it in their deeds, that is using it
unlawfully. For such an one uses it, but not to his own
, profit. And another way may be named besides. What is
Ἴ, it? that the laW, if thou use it aright, sends thee to Christ.
, For since its aim is to justify man, and it fails to effect this,
it remits us to Him who can do so, Another way again of
using the⁴ law lawfully, is when we keep it, but as a thing
superfluous. And how as a thing superfluous? As the
. bridle is properly used, not by the prancing horse that
champs it, but by that which wears it only for the sake of
appearance, so he uses the law lawfully, who govems himself,
2} though not as constrained by the letter of it. He uses the
‚31²7 law lawfully who is conscious that he does not need it, for
’ he who is already so virtuous that he fulfils it not from sear
