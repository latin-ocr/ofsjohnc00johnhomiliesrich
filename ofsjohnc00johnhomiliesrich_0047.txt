Pleasures ossz'n unsatisfyiny. 21

one might well say there is no pleasure in fornication itself. Hom:
For when passion has deprived the soul of its judgment, can
there be any real delights? As well might we say that the
itch is a pleasure ! Ι should call that true pleasure, when the
soul is not affected by passion, not agitated nor overpowered
by the body. For what pleasure can it be to grind the
teeth‚ to distort the eyeS, to be irritated and inflamed beyond
’ decency? But so far is it from being pleasant, that men
hasten to escape from it, and when it is over are in pain.
But if it were pleasure, they would wish not to escape from it,
but to continue it. lt has therefore only the name of plea-

SUI‘O .

 

But not such are the pleasures enjoyed by us3 they are
truly delightful, they do not agitate nor inflame. They leave
the soul free, and cheer, and expand it. Such was the plea-
sure of Paul when he said, In this I rejoice, yea, and I will Phil,
rejoice ,· and again, Rejoice in the Lord always. For sinful ὲῇὲὸ·
pleasure is attended with shame and condemnation3 it is in· 4, 4·
dulged in secret, and is attended with infinite uneasiness.
But from all these the true pleasure is exempt. This then
let 118 pursue‚ that we may attain those good things to come,
through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
Whom &Q
