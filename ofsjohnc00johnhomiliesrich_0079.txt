must fulfil his part. We do it, not as wishing to bring Hom.
heavier condemnation upon you, but to avert it from ourselves. V '
And besides this, love for you constrains us, for it would
tear and torture our hearts if that should befal γοα, which
God avert! It is not any eostly process that we recommend
to‘ you: it does not require the spoiling of goodS, nor a long
and toilsome journey. It is only to will. It is a word, it is a
purpose of the mind. Let us only set a guard on our tongueS,
a door and a bar upon our lips, that we may utter nothing
offensive to God. It is for our own advantage, not for theirs
for whom we pray, to act thus. For let us ever consider, that
he who blesses his enemy, blesses himself, he who curses
his enemy, curses himself, and he who prays for his enemy,
prays not for him, but for himself. If we thus act, we shall
be able to reduce to practise this excellent virtuee, and so
to obtain the promised blessingS, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ.
