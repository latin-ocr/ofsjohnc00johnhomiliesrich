274 Trutlt cmd T ype. God's eternal Promise-

Trros srom error. Observe how the introduction is full of the >

Qmercies of God, and this whole Epistle is especially of the
same character, thus exciting the holy man himself, and his =.
disciples als0, to greater exertions. For nothing profits us
so much as constantly to remember the mercies of God,
whether public or private. And if our hearts are warmed ⁷
when we receive the savours of our friends, or hear some kind ³
word or deed of theirs, much more shall we be zealous in Α
His service when we see into what dangers we had fallen, ³
and that God has delivered us from them all.

And tlte aelcrtowledyiny qs the truth. This he says with
reference to the type. For that was an aeknowledyiny and a
yodlz‘ness‚ yet not of the Truth Ρ, yet neither was it falsehood,
it was godliness, but it was in type and figure. And he has

 

well said, In hope of eterrzal life. For the former was in
Rom. hope of the present life. For it is said, lae that doeth these
10, 5· thirty-s shall live in them. You see how at the beginning he
sets forth the difference of grace. They are not the elect,
but we. For if they were once called the elect, yet are they
no longer called so.

Ver. 2. Which God, that cannot lie, promised before the

world heyam.

That is, not now upon a change of mind, but from the

beginning it was so foreordained. This he often assertS‚

as when he says, Separated unio {he Gospel of God. And

· again, Wleom He did forelcnow, He also did predestinate.

ἔξω· 8⁹ Thus shewing our high origin, in that He did not love us ἦ
now first, but from the beginning: auditis no little matter
to be loved of old, and from the beginning.

(2) Which God, that cannot lie, promised. If He cannot lie,
what He has promised will assuredly be fulfilled. If He
cannot lie, we ought not to doubt it, though it be after death.
Which. God, that cannot lie, he sayS, promised before the
world heyam ; by this als0‚ before the world beqan, he shews
that it is worthy of our belief. It is not because ,the Jews
have not come in, that these things are promised. It had
been so planned from the first. Hear therefore what he sayS,

Rom. 1,

‚¹³ Thus our Lord, speaking as a J ew, comem, and now is, when the true wor-
sald, <John 4, 22.) We know what we shefflwrs shall worship the 'Father in
worshtp5 and yet v. 23. The bour spurii andin trulla.
