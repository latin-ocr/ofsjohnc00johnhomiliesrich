Teacher, he would be lifted up into insolence. If before he
had learnt to be under rule, 116 should be appointed one of
the rulerS, he would be puffed up: therefore he adds, Lest

tlte devil, that is, into the same condemnation which Satan
incurred by his pride.

This is rightly said, as he was certain to be reproached by

he may not therefore confine them within too narrow a li'mit,
