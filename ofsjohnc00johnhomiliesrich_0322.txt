were different, they were of a nobler character.

Ver. 14. Not yivirzy laced, he says, to Jewislzfable-S.

The Jewish tenets were fables in two ways, because they Δ

were imitations, and because the thing was past its season, ·

for such things become fables at last. For when a thing ,

ought not to be done, and being done, is injurious, it is a

fable even as it is useless. As then those‘ ought not to be i

regarded, so neither ought these. For this is not being sound. >

For if thou believest the Faith, why dost thou add other things,

as if the Faith were not sufficient to justify? Why dost thou

 

enslave thyself by subjection to the Law ? Hast thou no con· f

The swine therefore is clean. Why then was it forbidden ’
as unclean? It was not unclean by nature3 sor, all chiny-s· are ¹
pure. Nothing is more unclean than a fish, inasmuch as it
even feeds upon human flesh. But it was permitted and con-

from eating serpents. Yet all these were eaten. Why then
was the swine forbidden, and many other things? Not be-
cause they were unclean, but to check excessive luxury. But
had this been said, they would not have been persuaded 3
