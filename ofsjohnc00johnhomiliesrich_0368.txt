PBH»- we do for the sake of men, and of the opinion of men, and

1, 3⁶ from the dread or the respect of men. If then we have so
many things to answer for, we ought with all alacrity to -
forgive those who injure uS‚ who defraud ηε, and not to bear
malice. For there is a way to the forgiveness of our sins ³
that needs no laboum, nor expense of wealth, nor any other
things, but merely our own choice. We have no need to set
out upon our traveIS, nor go beyond the boundaries of our
country, nor submit to dangers and toils, but only to will.

What excuse, tell me, shall we have in things that appear
difficult‘, when we do not do even a light thing, attended too

Woe is me! How much of goodness do we receive, and what
wickedness do we shew in retum! What sleepiness! what
indolence! How easy a thing is virtue, attended too with
much advantage; and how laborious a thing is vice ! But we,
flying srom that which is so light, pursue that which is hea-
vier than lead.

Here there is no need of bodily strength, nor of wealth, nor
possessions, nor of power, nor of friendship‚ nor of any other
thing; but it is sufficient only to will, and all is accomplished.
Hath some one grieved thee, and insulted thee, and mocked
thee? But consider, how often thou hast done such things to
