slaughter and blood, the other with reference to endurance,
that he might bear every thing with fortitude, and be ever in
exercise.

Tlaee husbandman that laboureth must beflrst partaker of
thefruz‘ts. ,

He had first spoken from his own example as a teacher.
He now speaks from those that are more common, as wrest-
lers and soldierS, and in their case he sets before him the
rewards. First, that he may please him who hath chosen
him to be a soldier3 secondly, that he may be crowned; now
he proposes a third example that more particularly suits him-
self. For the instance of the soldier and the wrestler corre-
sponds to those who are under rule, but that of the husband-
man to the Teacher. (Strive) not as a soldier or a wrestler
only, but as a husbandman too. The husbandman takes
care not of himself alone, but of the frnits of the earth. That
is, no little reward of his labours is enjoyed hythe husbandman.

Here he both sheWS, that to God nothing is wanting, and ¹
that there is a reward for Teaching, which he shews by a
common instance. As the husbandman, he sayS, does not
labour without profit, but enjoys before others the fruits of ’
his own toils, so is it fit that the teacher should do: either
he means this, or he is speaking of the honour to be paid to
teacherS, but this is less consistent. For why does he not
say the husbandman simply, but him that laboureth? not
only that worketh, but that is worn with toil? And here with
reference to the delay of reward, that no one may be impa-
tient, he sayS, thou reapest the fruit already, or there is a re-
ward in the labour itself. When therefore he has set before
him the examples of soldierS, of wrestlers, and husbandmen, ¹
and all figuratively, No one‚he sayS, is crowned except he strzve
lawfully. And having observed that the husbandman who
laboureth must first be partalcer of thefruitS, he adds,

Consider what I say, and the Lord yive thee understand-
inq in all thinqs.

Itis on this account that he has spoken these things in
proverb and parable. Then again to shew his affectionate

disposition, he ceases not to pray for him, as fearing for his
own son, and he sayS,
