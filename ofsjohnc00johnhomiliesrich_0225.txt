On what account is this mentioned? It is directed chiefly
against the heretiCS, at the same time to encourage Timothy,
by shewing the advantage of sufferings‚ since Christ, our
Master, Himself overcame death by suffering. Remember
this, he says, and thou wilt have sufficient comfort. Remem-
ber that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from
tlte dead. For upon that point many had already begun to

soldiers of this world, and waged an earthly warfare, the
chains that confine our hands would avail. But now God
