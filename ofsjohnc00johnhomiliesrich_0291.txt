above others. For a woman, as such, meets not with any HOM-
¹ impediments. It is the work of divine grace, that this sex X.
should be impeded only in the affairs of this life, or rather not
Ι even in them. For a woman undertakes no small share of
the whole administration, being the keeper of the house.
And without her not even political affairs could be properly
conducted. For if their domestic concerns were in a state of
confusion and disorder, those who are engaged in public
affairs would be kept at home, and politica] business would
be ill managed. So that neither in those matterS, as neither
in spiritual, is she inferior. For she is able, if so inclined,
to endure athousand deathS. Accordingly many women have
suffered martyrdom. She is able to practise chastity even
more than men, no such strong flame disturbing her; and
. to shew forth modesty and gravity, and kelmes-9, without Heb.12,
which no one shall see tke Lord; and contempt of wealth,¹4·
if she will, and in short all other virtues.

Ver. 22. lee Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.

There can be no better prayer than this. Grieve not for
my departure. The Lord will be with thee. And he sayS,
not ⁴ with thee,’ but with thy spirit. Thus there is a twofold
assistance, the grace of the Spiritf‚ and God helping it. And
otherwise God will not be with us, if we have not spiritual
grace. For if we be deserted by grace, how shall He be
with us?

Grac-e be uilla us, Amen.

Thus he prays for himself too, that they may always be
well-pleasing to Him‚ that they may have grace together with
the spiritual gift, sor where this is, nothing will be grievous.
For as he who beholds the king, and is in favour with him,
