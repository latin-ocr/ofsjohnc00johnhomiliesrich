dead. For nothing relating to the life to come moves or -
affects him. For intemperance, taking him into her own Ἴ
11080111, 38 11110 801116 dark and dismal cavern, fullos all un- ’
61631111688, causes him to dwell altogether in darkness, like
the dead. For when all 1118 111116 18 spent between feasting
and drunkenneSS‚ is he not dead, and buried in darkness?
Even in the morning when he seems to be sober, he is not .
sober in reality, since he has not yet rid and cleansed
himself of yesterday’s excess and is still longing for a repe· .
tition, and in that his evening and noon he passes in reveIS‚ {³

Is he then to be numbered with the living? Who can describe
that storm that comes of luxury, that assails his 80111 and body ?
For as 3 sky 6011111111311)7 clouded admits not the sunbeams ·
to shine through it, so the fumes of luxury and wine enve-
loping his brain, as if it were some rock, and casting over it 3
thick mist, suffer not reason to exert itself, but overspread f
the drunken man with profound darkness. With him who is ’
111118 affected, how great must be the storm within, how vio· ,-
lent the tumult. As when a flood of water has risen, and has ,
8111111011111611 1116 entrances of the workshops ἀ, we see all the ·
1111113168 111 confusion, and using tubs and pitchers and spongeS,
and many other contrivances to bale it out, that it may not
both undermine the building, and spoil all that is contained j
in it: so it is when luxury overwhelms the soul; its reason—
ings within are disturbed. What is already collected, cannot
be discharged, and by the introduction of more, a violent storm ῑ
18 raised. For look not at the cheerful and merry countenance,
but examine the interior, and you will see it full of deep de· ¹
jection. If it were possible to bring the soul into view, and
to behold it with our bodily eyes, that of the luxurious would
seem depressed, mournful, miserable, and wasted with 16311-
11688; for the more the body grows sleek and grOSS, the more lean

2,ngst and weakly is the soul; and the more one is pampered¹, the

2 602ae«.- more is the other hampered2'. As, when the pupil of the eye
