tures, not to introduce the labours of questioning, but to
end them, that we may ascertain and settle their true mean—
ing, not that we may be ever questioning, but that we may
have done with it. And he justly said, Charqe some that
they teach no other doctrine, neither yive heed to sables,
(md endless yenealoyies, which minister questions rather
than the dispensation of God infaith ¹¹. J ustly has he said,
the dispensatiore of God. For great are the blessings which
God is willing to dispense3 but the greatness of them is not
conceived by reasoning. This must then be the work of
saith, which is the best medicine of our 501115. This ques-
tioning therefore is opposed to the dispensation of God.
For what is dispensed by saith? To receive His mercies and.
become better men3 to doubt and dispute of nothing3 but to
repose in confidence. For what ‘ ministers questions' dis-
places saith and that which faith hath wrought and builded.
Christ has said that we must be saved by saith 3 this these
teachers questioned and even denied. For since the an-
nouncement was present, but the issue of it future, saith was
required. But they beingpreoccupied by legal observances
threw impediments in the way of saith. He seems also here
to glance at the Greeks, where he speaks of fables and
yereealoyz'es, for they enumerated their Gods.

Let us not then give heed to questions. For.we were
called Faithful‚ that we might unhesitatingly believe what is
delivered to us, and entertain no doubt. For if the things
asserted were human, we ought to examine them3 but since
they are of God, they are only to be revered and believed.
If we believe not, how shall we be persuaded of the existence
of a G-od? For how knowest thou that there is a Orod, when
thou callest Him to account? The knowledge of God is best
shewn by believing in Him without proofs and demonstra-
tions. Even the Greeks know this; for they believed
their Gods, telling them, saith one, even without proof 3 and
what ἓ--Τ11ἃῑἰ they were the offspring of the Gods. But why
do I speak of the Gods? In the case of a man, a deceiver
