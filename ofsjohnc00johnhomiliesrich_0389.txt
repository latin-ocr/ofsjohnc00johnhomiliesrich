 

W‘leoever wilc may escape punishment. 363

Prophet‚ saying‚ The riykteous shall rejoice when he seeth Hom.

the venyeance upon the unquy, he shall wash leis hands in

God forbid! but searing lest he should suffer the same thingS,
he will render his own life more pure. This then is a mark
of His great care. YeS, you say, but He ought only to
threaten, and not to punish also, But if He does punish,
and still you say it is a matter of threat, and on that account
become more slothsul, if it were really but a threat, would
you not become more supine? If the Ninevites had known
it was a matter of threat, they would not have repented.
But because they repented, they caused the threat to stop at
words only. Dost thou wisb it to be a threat only? Thou
hast the disposal of that matter. Become a better man, and
2 it stops only at the threat. But if, which be far from thee!
ἶ thou despisest the threat, thou wilt come to the experience

And we, if we fear the threat, shall not expose ourselves to
experience the reality. God forbid we should. And may
the merciful God grant that we all henceforth, having been
brought to a sound mind, may obtain those unspeakable
blessingS. Of which may we all be thought worthy, through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord J esus Christ, with
Whom to the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be
glory, power, and honour, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
