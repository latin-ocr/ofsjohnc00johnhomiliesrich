of grace. For the Jews had no prayers for the Gentiles; but
now grace is extended to them: and when he says that he

that grace was now shed over every part of the world.

He yave himself a ransom, he saith, how then was He de-
livered up by the Father? Because it was of His goodness. And
what means ransom? God was about to punish them, but He
forbore to do it. They were about to pelish, but in their
stead He gave His own Son, and sent us as heralds to pro-
claim the Cross. These things are sufficient to attract all,
and to demonstrate the love of Christ. So truly, so inexpres- Mona.
sibly great are the> benefits which Gopd has bestowed upon ηε.

v He sacrificed Himself sor His enemies‚ who hated and re-
2 jected Him. What no one would do for friends, for brethren,
⁹ for children, that the Lord hath done for His servants3 a
’ Lord not Himself such an one as His servants, but God for

inducement‚ it should be sufficient to prevail with every one
that He condescended to make human sufferings His own, to
say I hunger, Ι thirst.

’ O the tyranny of wealth! or rather the wickedness of those
who are its willing slaves ! for it has no great power of itself,
but through our weakness and servilityk: it is we that are
mean and grovelling, that are carna] and without understand-
ing. For what power has money? It is mute and insensible.

³ ἰνάμαν. Montf. observes that all of the Apostles, but not universally.
