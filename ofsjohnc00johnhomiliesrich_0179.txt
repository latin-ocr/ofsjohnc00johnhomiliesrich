There is need not only of profession, but of patience also
to persevere in that profession, and of vehement contention,
and of numberless toils, that you be not overthrown. For
many are the stumbling-blocks, and impediments, therefore
κ the way is struit and narrffow It is necessary therefore to Matt. 7,
be self- collected¹, and well gi1t on every side. All around, 14. v„

what evil is not caused by wealth, or rather not by wealth,
but by the wicked will of those who know not how to use it?

For it is possible to use wealth in well doing, ancl even through
means of it to inherit the kingdom. But now what was given
