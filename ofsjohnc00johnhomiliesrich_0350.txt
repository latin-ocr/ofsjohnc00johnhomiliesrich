324 Arquiny with obstinate heretics is waste qs labour.

T1rus that are afflicted. For this is to maintain good works. For
3' 12. these thingS, 116 sayS, are good and profitable unto men. But
avoid foolislc questione, and yenealoyie8‚ and contentione,
and strivinys about the law, for they are unprofitable and
vain. What do these yenealoyies mean? For in his Epistle
1 Tim.1, to Timothy he mentions sables and endless yenealoyies.
4· [Perhaps both here and there glancing at the JeWS, wh0,
priding themselves on having Abraham for their forefather,
neglected their own part. On this account he calls them both ’
foolislz and unprofitable ; for it is the part of folly to confide
in things unprofitable⁸.] ContentionS, 116 means, with hereticS,
in which he would not have us labour to no purpose, where
nothing is to be gained, for they end in nothing. For when
a man is perverted and predetermined not to change his mind,
whatever may happen, why shouldest thou labour in vain,
sowing upon a rock, when thou shouldest spend thy honour-
able toil upon thy own people, in discoursing with them
upon almsgiving and every other virtue? How then does he
2Tim.2, elsewhere say, If God peradventure will yive them repent-
25· ance‚· but here, Α man that i-s· an heretic dfter the first and
second admonition reject, knowiny that ke that is such is
subverted and sinnetlz, being] condemned Qf himself .P In the ,
former passage he speaks of the correction of those of whom
he had hope, and who had simply made opposition. But
1 wma- when he is known and manifest to all, why dost thou contend1
‘¹‘ in vain? why dost thou beat the air? What meanS, beinq
condemned qfhimsegf? Because he cannot say that no one
has told him, no one admonished him3 since therefore aster

admonition he continues the same, 116 is self-condemned.
Ver. 12. When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or T ychi-
cus; be dilzy'ent to come nnio me to Nicopolis. What sayes't
thou? After having appointed him to preside over Crete,
dost thou again summon him to thyself? It was not to with-
20-740233e draw him from that occupation2, but to discipline him the
more for it. For that he does not call him to attend upon him,
as if he took him every where with him as his follower,

appears from what he adds:
For I have determined there to winter.
