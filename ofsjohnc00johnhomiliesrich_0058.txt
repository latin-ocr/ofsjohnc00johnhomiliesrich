salvation by it without saith. Against this he contends3 for
it seemed to them incredible, that a man who had mis· -spent
all his former life in vain and wicked actionS, should after-
wards be saved by his saith alone. On this account he says,
It is a sayiny to be believed. But some not only disbelieved,
but even objected, as the Greeks do now. Let us then do
evil, that qood may come. This was the consequence they

,drew in derision of our saith, from his words, leere sin

abounded‚ qraee did much more abozmd. So when we dis-
course to them of Hell, they say, How can this be worthy
of God? When man has found his servant offending, he for-
gives it, and thinks him worthy of pardon3 and does God
punish eternally? And when we speak of the Laver, and of
the remission of sins through it, this too they say is unworthy
of God, that he who has committed offences without number
should have his sins remitted. What perverseness of mind is
this, what a spirit of contention does it manifest! Surely if
forgiveness is an evil, punishment is a good3 but if punish-
ment is an evil, remissiori of it is a good. I speak according
to their notionS, for according to ourS, both are good. This
Ι shall shew at another time, for the present would not suffice
for a matter so deep, and which requires to be elaborately
argued. I must lay it before your Charity at a fitting season.
At present let us proceed with our proposed subject. This
is a faithful sayiny, he says. But why is it to be believed?
This appears both from what precedes and from what
follows. Observe how he prepares usb for this assertion,
and how he then dwells upon it. For he hath previously
declared that He shewed mercy to me a blasphemer and a
persecutor ; this was in the way of preparation. And not only
did He shew mercy, but He accomzted me faithfiael. So far
should we be, he meam, from disbelieving that He shewed
mercy. For no one, who should see a prisoner admitted into
a palace, could doubt whether he obtained mercy. And this
was visibly the situation of Paul, for he makes himself the

example. Nor is he ashamed to call himself a sinner, but ⁷

rather delights in it, as he thus can best demonstrate the
mir-acle of God’s regard for him, and that He had thought
him worthy of such extraordinary kindness.
