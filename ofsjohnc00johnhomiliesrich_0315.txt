But he, who enjoys more honour, besides being responsible H'
, sor great debts, is lifted up into arrogance and vainglory, and
becomes the slave of men3 and as this tyranny increaseS, he
is compelled to do many things which he would not.

Knowing therefore that it is better to want glory, than to (4)
possess it, let us not seek for honours, but erade them when
they are offered, let us cast them from us, let us extinguish
that desire. This we have said at once to the rulers of the
Church, and to those under their rule. For a soul desirous
of honour, and of being glorified, shall not see the kingdom
of heaven. This is not my own saying. Ι speak not my
own words, but those of the Spirit of God. He shall not
see it, though he practise virtue. For He saith, They Matt. 6,
have their reward. He then, who has no reward to re-5·

they are, fashioned to the extreme height of elegance.
Canst thou shew me any such real countenance? By no
means. What then? didst thou ever fall in love with them?
No. Wherefore? Because they are empty, imitating beauty,
but not being really beautiful. Thus human glory is empty,
and an imitation of glory: it is not true glory. That beauty
only which is natural, which is within, is lasting: that which
is put 011 externally often conceals deformity, conceals it
from men till the evening. But when the theatre breaks up,

and the masks are taken off, each appears what he really is.
Let us therefore pursue truth, and not be as if we were on
