92 Graces qs the soul the true ornaments,

1 Tm. virtuous? use not such distinctions. Have ornaments in
δ’ ¹ ¹ ’Μ’ thyself. Be not indebted for thy glory to the presence of others.
To such honour the most wicked, corrupt, and base of men

may attain; all indeed who are rich. Actors and dancers

may ride on horseback with a servant running before themg

yet are they but actors and dancers still. Their horses and
attendants procure them no respect. For when the graces of

the soul are wanting to such persons, the addition of these
external things is superfluous and vain. And as when a wall

is weak, or a body disordered, whatever you put upon it, it

still remains unsound and decayed3 so in this case3 the soul
continues the same, and receives no advantage from thingswith-

out, not though the man wear a thousand ornaments of gold.

Let us not therefore be anxious for such things. Let us
withdraw ourselves from tempora] thingS, and pursue greater,

even spiritual distinctionS, which will render us truly objects

> of veneration, that we ⁴ also may obtain the blessings of

futurity, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
J esus Christ, with VVhom, &c.
