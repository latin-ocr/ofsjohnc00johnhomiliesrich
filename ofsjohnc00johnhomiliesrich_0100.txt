74 No inlacritance like virtue. Α Mother's duty to dauyltteos.

1 Tm- commit our son as the guardian of his moraIS, though this
3’ l. is a possession much more valuable than all others. It is for
him indeed that we take such care of our estate. We take
care of our possessions for our children, but of the children
themselves we take no care at all· What an absurdity is
this! Form the soul of thy son might, and all the rest will
be added hereafter. If that is not good, he will derive no
advantage from his wealth, and if it is formed to goodness
he will suffer no harm from poverty. Wouldest thou leave
him rich? teach him to be good: for so he will be able to
acquire wealth, or if not, he will not fare worse than they
who possess it. But if he be wicked, though you leave him
boundless wealth, you leave him no one to take care of it,
and you render him worse than those who are reduced to
extreme poverty. For poverty is better than riches for those

children who are not well-disposed. For it retains them in

 

some degree of virtue even against their will. Whereas
money does not suffer those who would be sober to continue

infinite dangers.

For if you form them in this way, you will save not only
them, but the husband who is destined to marry them, and
not the husband only, but the children, not the children only,
but the grandchildren. For the root being made good, good
branches will shoot forth, and still become better, and for all
these you will receive a reward. Let us do all things there-
fore, as benefiting not only one soul, but many through that
one. For they ought to go from their fathers' house to
marriage, as combatants from the school of exercise, furnished
with all necessary knowledge, and to be as leaven able to
transsorm the whole lump to its own virtue. And let your
sons be so modest, as to be distinguished for their steadiness
and sobriety‚ that they may receive great praise both from
God and men. Let them learn to govern their appetiteS, to
