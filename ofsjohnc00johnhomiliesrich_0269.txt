Sufferiny needful to tlte Riyleleous. 243

For the wicked will possibly be punished, but the good can Hom.
not always be rejoicing. No one was equal to Paul, yet he VIII.
passed all his life in afflictions, in tears and groanings night
and day. For the space of three yearS, he sayS, I ceased {³210th
not to marn· every one niyht and day with tems, And again: ’
nat which comella upon· me daily. He did not rejoice to· 1 Cor.
day, and grieve to-morrOW, but he ceased not daily to g1·ieve.¹¹’ 28·
How then does he say, Evil men shall waoe worse and worse?
He has not said, they shall find rest, but they shall wast:
worse and worse. Their progressis for the worse. He has ’
not said, they shall be in prosperity. But if they are
punished, ‘they are punished that thou mayest not suppose
their sins are unavenged. vFor since we are not deterred
from wickedness by the fear of hell, in very tenderness He
rouses us *from our insensibility, and awakens us, If no
wicked man was ever punished‚ no one would believe that
God presides over human affairs. If all were punished, no
one would expect a future resurrection, since all had received
their due here. On this account He both punisheS, and
3 forbears to punish. On this account the righteous suffer
} tribulation here, because they are sojournerS, and strangers,
⁸ and are in a foreign country. The just therefore endure
these things for the purpose of trial. For hear what God
said to J ob: Thiwlcest tlzou that Ι leave warned thee other· Job 40,
wise, tlzcm that thou miyhtest appear jus-N? But sinners3' Gr.
when they endure any affiiction, suffer but the punishment
of their sins, Under all circumstanceS, therefore, whether
afflictive' or otherwise, let us give thanks to God. For both
are beneficial. He does nothing in hatred or enmity to uS,
but all things from care and consideration for ηε.

And speaking of the holy Scriptures, he has added,
