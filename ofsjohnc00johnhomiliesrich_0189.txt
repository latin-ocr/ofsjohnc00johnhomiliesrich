impose these laws? ‘ Be offensive and impudent, shameless XVIH.
and bold, villainous and wicked‚ ungratefffl, unfeehng, un-

 

friendly‚ faithleSS, devoid of affection, a parricide, a beast
rather than a man. Surpass the serpent in bitterneSS, the
wolf in rapacity. Exceed in brutality even the beast, nay
should it be necessary( to proceed even to the malignity of
the devil, refuse not. Be a stranger to thy benefactor.’

Does not avarice say all this, and is it not listened to? God
on the contrary says, Be a friend to all, be gentle, beloved
Ἰ by all, give offence causelessly to no one. Honour thy father
ζ and thy mother. Win an honourable reputation. Be not a
ἦ man, but an angel. Utter nothing immodest‚ nothing false,
nor even think of it. Relieve the poor. Bring not trouble
ι on thyself, by ravaging others. Be not bold nor insolent.
’ God says this, but no one hearkens. Is not hell then justly
f threatened, and the fire, and the worm that dieth not? How
long are we thus to thrust ourselves down the precipice?
· How long are we to wall< upon thoms, and pieree ourselves
with naiIS‚ and be grateful for it? We subject ourselves to
cruel tyrants, and refuse the gentle Master‚ who imposes
nothing grievous, nor barbarOUS, nor burdensome, nor un-
profitable,but all things such as are useful, and valuable, and
beneficial. Let us then arouse ourselves, and be sels-collected,
and gather our forces. Let us love God as we ought, that
’ ‘we may obtain the blessings promised to those that love Him,

¹ through the grace and mercy of our Lord J esus Christ, with
' Whom, to the Father‚ &c.
