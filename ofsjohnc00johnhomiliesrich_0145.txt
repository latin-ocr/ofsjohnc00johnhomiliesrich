Thus ought we ever to exercise hospitality by our own
personal exertionS, that we may be sanctified, and our hands
be blessed. And if thou givest to the poor, disdain not thy-
self to give it, for it is not to the poor that it is given, but to

You give your money, and with it your sins pass away. Such
