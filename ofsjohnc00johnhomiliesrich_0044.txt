are filled with its glory, yet much more will things future be
so3 when His enemies shall be put under Hisseet, when there
shall be nothing opposed, when the just shall behold all

blessed, considering what felicities they will then enjoy, of
what light and glory they will then participate. The glory
of this world is worthless and not enduring, or if it abideS‚ it
abides but till death, and after that is wholly extinguished.
For lzz's ylory, it sayS, shall not descend after him. And with
many it lasts not even to the end of life. But no such thing
is to be thought of in that glory3 it abides, and will have no

have their glory in themselves, Yea rather as the sun needs
no vestureS‚ and requires no foreign aid, but wherever he
appearS, his glory at once shines forth3 so shall it then be.
Let us then pursue that glory, than which nothing is more
venerable3 and leave the glory of the world, as beyond any
