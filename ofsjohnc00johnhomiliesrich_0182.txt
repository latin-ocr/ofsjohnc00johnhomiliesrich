156 Moral beaucy and worth real.

1 Tm. the deceit. The beauty therefore was not in the nature of

⁸6, 12. the thing. Neither is it in silver3 you may admire tin for
silver, as you admired brass for gold, and you need some one
to inform you what you should admire. Thus our eyes are
not sufficient to discern the difference. It is not so with ³
flowers, which are much more beautiful. If you see a rose,
you need no one to inform you, you can of yourself distinguish
an anemone, and a violet, or a lily, and every other flower.
It is nothing therefore but prejudic-e. And to sheW, that
this destructive passion is but a prejudice3 tell me, if the
Emperor were pleased to ordain that silver should be of more
value than gold, would you not transfer your love and ad-
miration to the former? Thus we are every where under the
influence of covetousness and opinioni. And that it is 80,
and that a thing is valued for its rarity, and not for its
nature, appears hence. The fruits that are held cheap among
us are in high esteem among the Cappadociam, and among
the Seriansk even more valuable than the most precious
among uS, from which country these garments are brought 3
and many such instances might be given in Arabia and India,
where spices are produced, and where precious stones are
found. Such preference therefore is nothing but prejudice,
and human opinion. We act not from judgment, but at
random, and as accident determines. ssut let us recover
from this intoxication, let us fix our view upon that which is
truly beautiful, beautiful in its own nature, upon godliness
and righteousness3 that we may obtain the promised blessings,

through the grace and lovingkindness of Jesus Christ our
Lord, with Whom, διο.
