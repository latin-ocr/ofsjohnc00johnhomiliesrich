‘232 Love to man britzys love to God, and casis out sin.

2‘T1M· gold is a heavy accusation against them. lt is our condemn·-

δ’ 1-7. ation that we are not so beside ourselves for God3 that we

do not bestow upon the Lord of all as much love as they be-
stow upon mere earth, for gold from the mine is no better.

(3) Let us then behold their madness, and be ashamed of our-

selves. For what though we are not inflamed with the love ,

of gold, while we are not earnest in our prayers to God? For

in their case men despise wife, children, substance, and their ³

own safety, and that when they are not certain that they ξ

shall increase their substance. For often, in the very midst

of their hopes, they lose at once their life and their labour.

But we, though we know that, if we love Him as we ought

to love Him, we shall obtain our desire, yet love Him not,

but are altogether cold in our love both to our neigh-

bour and to God3 cold in our love to God, because cold in

our love to our neighbour. For it is not, indeed it is not

possible that a man, who is a stranger to the feeling of love,

should have any generosity or manly spirit, since the found-

²2⁷ 4⁰· said, lacmy all tlte law and tlte prophet& For as fire set to a
forest is wont to clear away every thing, so the fire of love,
wherever it is received, consumes and makes way through
every thing that is hurtful to the divine harvest, and renders the

 

 

soil pure and fit for the reception of the seed. Where there
is love, all evils are removed. There is no love of money,
the root of evil, there is no self-loved: there is no boasting;
for why should one boast over his friend? Nothing makes a
man so humble as love. We perform the offices of servants
to our friends, and are not asharned; We are even thankful
for the opportunity of serving them. We spare not our pro-
perty, and often not our persons; for- dangers too are encoun-
tered at times for him that is loved. No envy, no calumny
is there, where there is genuine love. We not only do not
slander our friends, but We stop the mouth of slanderers.. All
is gentleness and mildness.' Not a trace of strife and con-
Ro1n.13‚ tention appears. Every thing breathes peace. For, Love, it is

with it. How so? Because where love existS, all the sins
