In the last days perilous times shall come, he sayS, that
is, exceeding bad 1111168. How shall times be perilous⁸? He
says it not blaming the dayS, nor the timeS, but the men of those
times. For thus it is customary with us to speak of good
times or evil times, from the events that happen in them,
caused by men. Immediately he sets down the root and
fountain, whence these and all other evils spring, that is,
overweeningness. He that is seized with this passion is
careless even of his own interestS. For when a man over—
looks the 6011661118 of his neighbour, and is careless of them,
how should he regard his own? For as he that looks to his
neighbour's affairs will in them order his own to advantage,
so 116 11161 looks down upon his neighbour’s concerns will
neglect his own. For if we are members one of another,

of thy own members hath suffered no small hurt. And if he,
who does not impart of his possessionS, goes into Hell, much
more will he be condemned, who sees 6 1161311100111 suffering

severer evils, and does not stretch out his hand, since in this
case the loss is more grievous.

For men· shall be lovers of their own selves.

He that loves himself may be said not to love himself, but
he that loves his brother, loves himself in the 1111681 861186.
From sels-love springs covetousness. For the wretched nig-
gardly temper of sels-love 6011116618 11161 love which should
be widely extended, and diffused on every side. Covetous.
From covetousness springs boastfulness, from boastfulness
pride, from pride blasphemy, from blasphemy defiance and
disobedience. For he who exalts himself against men, will
easily do it against God. Thus sins are produced. Often
they ascend from below. He that is pious towards men, is
still more pious towards God. He who is meek to his fellow
