is wanting. Suppose one to labour under a putrefying sore,
or consuming ulcer3 let him wash his body ever so much, it is
of no advantage. And if the putrefaction of the body receives
no benefit from cleansing and disguising the outward appear-
ance3 when the soul is infected with rottenness, what is
gained by the purity of the body? Nothing! Our pra-yers
ought to be pure, and pure they cannot be, if they are sent
forth from a corrupt soul, and nothing so corrupts the soul
as avarice and rapine. But there are some who after com-
mitting numberless sins during the day, wash themselves in1
the evening and enter the churches, holding up their hands*
with much confidence, as if by the washing of the bath theyv
had put off all their guilt. And if this were the case, itt
would be a vast advantage to use the bath daily! Ι wouldl
not myself cease to frequent the baths ¹¹, if it made us pure„
and cleansed us from our sins! But these things are trifling;

Matt.5‚ For He says, Blessed are the pure—does He say in body?
No—in beart: for they sIm-ll see God. And what says the:

14· It is of great use to be in the habit of doing good actionS.
See how trifling and unprofitable these washings are. But
when the soul is prepossessed b'y a habit, it does not depart
from it, nor does it venture to draw nigh in prayer, till it has
fulfilled these ceremonies. For instance, We have brought our-
selves to a habit of washing and praying, and without washing
We do not think it right to pray. And we do not willingly
pray with unwashed handS, as if we should offend Orod, and
violate our conscience. Now if this trifling custom has so great
power over us, and is observed every day3 if we had brought
ourselves to a habit of almsgiving, and had determined so
constantly to observe it, as never to enter a house of prayer
with empty handS, the point would be gained. For great is
