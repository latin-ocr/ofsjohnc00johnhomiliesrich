strictneSS, and eminent virtue. For when he speaks of that
which is comely, and that she may attend upon the Lord with-
out distraction, he gives, in a manner, a summary of all virtue.
You see that it is not merely the not contracting a second
marriage that is enough to make a widow, many other things
are necessary. But why does he discourage second marriages?
Is the thing condemned? By no means. That is heretical.
Only he would have her henceforth occupied in spiritual
things, transferring all her care to virtue. For marriage is
not an impure state, but one of much occupation. He speaks
of their having leisure‚ not of their being more pure by
remaining unmarried. For marriage certainly implies much
secular engagement. If you abstain from marriage that you
may have leisure for the service of God, and yet do not so
employ that leisure‚ it is of no advantage to yon, (if you do
not use your leisure‚) to perform all services to strangerS,
and to the Saints ¹¹. If you do not thus, you abstain from
marriage not for any good end, but as though you condemned
the state. So the virgin, who is not truly crucified to the
world, by declining marriage, appears to condemn it as
accursed and impure.

Observe, the hospitality here spoken of is not merely a
friendly reception, but one given with zeal and alacrity, with
readineSS, and going about it as if one were receiving Christ
Himself. The widows should perform these services them-

may be very rich, and of the highest rank, vain of her birth
and noble family, there is not the same distance between her
and others, as between God and the disciples. If thou
receivest the stranger as Christ, be not ashamed, but rather
glory: but if you rec‘eive him not as Christ, receive him not
at all. He tha-t receivetlz you, He said, receiveth Me. If
you do not so receive him, you have no reward. Abraham
was receiving men that passed as travellerS, as he thought,
and he did not leave to his servants to make the preparations
