Men dislilce the names qs* their own dead-5. 341

j ‹And if the king indeed commands us to abstain from other 11ssss-

Do you see then that we honour men more than God? It
is a sad and grievous saying, a heavy charge. But shew

Δ that it is grievous3 fiee from the fact! But if you sear not
; the fact, how can I believe you when you say, We fear your

but name the words of which you do the deeds, you are

May the thing spoken by me prove false! I would rather

¹. mysel'f in That Day bear the imputation of ill language, as
having vainly and causelessly reproached you, than see you
accused of such things.

But not only do you honour men more than God, but you
compe] others to do so likewise. Many have thus compelled
their domestics and slaves. Some have drawn them into
marriage against their will, and others have forced them to
minister to disgraceful services, to infamous love, to acts of
rapine, and fraud, and violence: so that the accusation is
twofold, and neither can they obtain pardon upon the plea
of necessity. For if you yourself do wrong things unwillingly,

’ and on account of the command of the ruler, not even so is
it by any means a sufficient excuse: but the offence becomes
heavier, when you compel them also to fall into the same
sins. For what pardon can there be any more for such an
.one?

These things I have said, not from a wish to condemn you,
but to shew in how many things we are debtors to God.
For if by honouring men even equally with God, we insult
God, how much more, when we honour men above Him?
But if those offences that are committed against men are
shewn to be much greater against God3 how much more
when the actual offence is greater and more grievous in its
own quality.

, Let any one examine himself, and he will see that he does
every thing onaccount of men. Exceedingly blessed we
should be, if we did as many things for the sake of God, as
