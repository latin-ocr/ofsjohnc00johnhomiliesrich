Joseph won tlte confidence of a Heathen master. 307

in obedience to thy master, bearing with him, though impatient‚ IV.

and angry without a cause. Consider that thou art not
gratifying him, but fulfilling the commandment of God3 then
thou wilt easily submit to any thing. And what I have said
before, I repeat here, that when our spiritual state is right,
⁴ the things of this life will follow. For a servant, so tractable
< and so well disposed, will not only be accepted by God, and
’ made partaker of those glorious crownS, but his master him-
self, whom he serves so well, even though he be brutish and
stone-hearted, inhuman and ferocious, will commend and ad-
mire him, and will honour him above all the rest, and will
set him over their headS, though he be a Gentile.

And that servants are required to be thus disposed towards

 

a Gentile master, Ι will shew you by an example. J oseph, who
was of a different religion from the Egyptian, was sold to the
chief cooke. What then did he? When he saw the young
man was virtuous, he did not consider the difference of their
religion, but loved and favoured and admired him, and com—
mitted the others to his superintendence, and knew nothing
- of the affairs of his own house because of him. Thus he was
a second master, and even more of a master than his lord, for
ἵ he knew more of his master’s affairs than his master himself.
And even afterwardS, as itsseems to me, when he believed the
unjust accusation framed against him by his wife, yet from his
ι former regard for him, retaining a respect sor that just man,
he satisfied his resentment with imprisonment. For if he
³ had not greatly reverenced and esteemed him from his former
² conduct, he would have thrust his sword through his body,

ῑ and dispatched him at once. Foryealousy is tlte raye (ff a Prov. 6,
1 man ,· therefore ke will not reyard any ransom, neither will ke 34· 3⁵·

Ᾰ rest content, though thou yivest many yffts. And if such is
² the jealousy of men in general, much more violent must it
³ have been with him, an Egyptian and barbarian, and injured
as he thought by one whom he had honoured. F or you all
κ know that injuries do not affect us in the same way from all
