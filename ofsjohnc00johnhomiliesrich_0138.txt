Momr.. She that livetlz in pleasure is dead whilst she livetlc. Hear
this, ye women, that pass your time in reveIS, and intemperance,
and who neglect the poor, pining and perishing with hunger,
whilst you are destroying yourselves with continual luxury.

Thus you are the causes of two deaths, of those who are dying

 

of want, and of your own, both through ill measure. But if out
of your fulness you tempered their want, you would save two
lives. Why do you thus gorge your own body with exceSS‚
and waste that of the poor with want3 why pamper this above
measure, and stint that too beyond measure? Consider what
comes of food, into what it is changed. Are you not disgusted
at its being named? Why then 110 eager for such accumula-
tions? The increase of luxury is but the multiplication of ι
dung! For nature has her limits, and what is beyond these
is not nourishment‚ but injury, and the increase of ordure.
Nourish the body, but do not destroy it. F ood is called
nourishment‚ to shew that its design is not to injure the body,
but to nourish it. For this reason perhaps food passes into
excrement, that ‚we may not be lovers of luxury. For if it
were not 50, if it were not useless and injurious to the body,
we should not cease from devouring one another. If the
belly receive as much as it pleased, digested it, and conveyed
it to the body, we should see wars and battles innumerable.
Even now when part of our food passes into ordure, part into
blood, part into spurious and useless phlegm, we are neverthe-
less so addicted to luxury, that we spend perhaps whole
estates on a 111031. What should we not do, if this were not
the end of luxury? The more luxuriously we live, the more
noisome are the odours with which we are filled. The body
is like a swollen bottle, running out every way. The eructa-
tious are such as to pain the head of a bystander. From the
heat ot fermentation within, vapours are sent forth, as from a
