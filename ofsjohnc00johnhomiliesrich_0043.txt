Grime-s· os {he Jews. The Gospel why called ylorious. 17

But the tractable horse needs not the curb, nor the man that Hom.
can dispense with instruction the schoolmaster. 11.

But for the lawless and disobedient,for the unyodly and
for sinum-&for the unholy and profane, for murderers of
fath-ers and murderers of mothers. Thus he does not stop
η at the mention of sins in general, nor of these only, but goes
over the several kinds of sin, to shame men, as it were, of being
under the direction of the law3 and having thus particularized
sdme, he adds a reference to those omitted, though what he
had enumerated were sufficient to withdraw men. Of whom
then does he say these things? Of the JeWS, for they were
murderers offatloers and m urderers ofmothers ; they were pro-
sarie and imbolffi for these too he means when he says, imyodly
and sinn-erc, and being such, the law was necessarily given to
them. For did they not repeatedly worship idols ? did they not

kindred? Do not the prophets constantly accuse them of these

the things which he had mentioned were the passions of a
corrupted soul‚ and contrary, therefore, to sound doctrine.

Thus the Law is still necessary for the confirmation of the
Gospel, yet to those who obey it is unnecessary. And he calls
the Gospel fioribus, There were some who were ashamed of its
persecutionS, and of the sufferings of Christ, and so for the sake
of these, as well as for otherS, he has called it the ylorious Gos-
pel, thus shewing that the sufferings of Christ are our glory.
And perhaps he glauces too at the future. Foris our present
state is exposed to shame and reproach‚ it will not be so here-
asten and 1t is to things future, and not to things present, that the
Gospel belongs. Why then did the Angel say, Beleold, I br' 21292Luke

Because He was born to be their Saviour, though His mira-
cles did not commence from His birth. According] to the 603-
