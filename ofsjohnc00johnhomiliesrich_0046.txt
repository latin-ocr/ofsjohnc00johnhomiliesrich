himself the notice of all, and whether at the bath, or the
assembly, or any other concourse of men, all follow him, and
observe him ; 80, in that world, when souis come in that
are fragrant with this spiritual savour, all arise and make
room. And even here devils and all vices are afraid to ap-
proach it, and cannot endure it, for it chokes them. Let us
then not bear about us that persume which is a mark of effemi-
nacy, but this, which is a mark of manhood, which is truly ad-
mirable, which fills us with a holy confidence. This is a
spice which is not the produce of the earth, but springs from
virtue, which withers not, but blooms for ever. This is it
that renders those who possess it honourable. With this we
are anointed at our Baptism, then we savour sweetly of it;
but it must be by our care afterwards that we retain the
savour. Of old the Priests were anointed with ointment, as
an emblem of the virtue, the fragrance of which a Priest should
diffuse around him.

But nothing is more offensive than the savour of sin,
which made the Psalmist say, My wozmds‘ stinlc and are cor-
rupt. For sin is more foul than putrefaction itself. What,
for instance, is more offensive than fornication? And if this is
not perceived at the time of its commission‚ yet, after it is
committed, its offensive nature, the impurity contracted in it,
and the curse² , and the abomination of it is perceived. So it is
with all sin. Before it is committed it has something of plea-
sure, but after its commission‚ the pleasure ceases and fades
away, and pain and shame succeed. But with righteousness it is
the reverse. At the beginning it is attended with toil, but in the
end with pleasure and repose. But even here, as in the one
case the pleasure of sin· is no pleasure, because of the expect-
ation of disgrace and punishment, so in the other the toil is
not felt as toil, by reason of the hope of reward. And what is
the pleasure of drunkenness? The poor gratification of
drinking, and hardly that. For when insensibility follows,
and the man sees nothing that is before him, and is in a
worse stato than a madman, what enjoyment remains? Nay,
