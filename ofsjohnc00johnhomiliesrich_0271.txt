life and death, are things indifferent. If thou knowest this,
thou wilt know thereby, that the righteous are afflicted that
they may be erowned, the wicked, that they may receive the

- punishment of their sins. But all sinners are not punished
here, lest the generality should disbelieve the Resurrection3
nor all the righteous afflicted‚ lest men should think that
vice, and not virtue, is approved. These are the rules and
limits. Bring what you will to the test of these, and you
will not be perplexed with doubt. For as there is among
calculators the number of six thousand, to which all things
ean be reduced, and every thing can be divided and multi-
plied in the scale of six thousand, and this is known to all
who are acquainted with arithmeticg 3 so he who knows those
ruleS, which Ι will briefly recapitulatae, will never be offended-

· And what are these? That virtue is a good, vice an evil; that
diseaseS, poverty, ill-treatment, false accusations, and the like,
are things indifferent3 that the righteous are afflicted here,
or if ever they are in prosperity‚ it is that virtue may not
appear odious; that the wicked enjoy pleasure now that
hereafter they may be punished, or if they are sometimes
visited, it is that vice may not seem to be approved, nor their
actions to go unpunished3 that all are not punished, lest
there should be a disbelief of the time of resurrection3 that
even of the good, some who have done bad actions are quit
of them here; and of the wicked, some have good oneS, and Matt. 6,
‘are rewarded for them here, that their wickedness may be ⁵·
punished hereafter3 that the works of God are for the most
part incomprehensible, and that the difference between us
and Him is greater than ean be expressed. If we reason on
these groundS, nothing will be able to trouble or perplex us.
If we listen to the Scriptures continually, we shall find many

such exampleS.
Which are able, he says, to make thee wis-e unto salvation.
