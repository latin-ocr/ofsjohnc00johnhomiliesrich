48 Daily Sero-icc. Prayersfor all men.

1 Tm, lose any thing of his affection for it; so we ought not to

when we are stricken by them. What is, first of all? It
means in the daily Service3 and the initiated know how this
is done every day both in the evening and the morning, how
we offer prayers for the whole world, for kings and all that
