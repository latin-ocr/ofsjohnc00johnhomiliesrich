from its being excessive it had become manifest, and had
reached even to Paul. And yet the distance between Rome
and Phrygia was not small. For he seems to have been there
from the mention of Archippus. For the Colossians were of 1
Phrygia, writing to whom he said, When this Epi-§tle is read
amony you, cause tlzat a be read also in tlte Clamosa (ff tlte
Laodiceam-9, ana' tlzat ye likewz'se read tlte Epi-alle from
Laodicea. And this is a city of Phrygia.

I pray, he says, tlzat tlte communicat-ion of thy saith, may
become effeetual 63] tlte aolmowledyiny of every qood thino
which is in Christ Jews, Dost thou see him first giving,
before he receiveS, and before he asks a favour himself
bestowing a much greater one of his own? Tkat tlte oom-
mwzication of tlzyfaitlz, he sayS, may become effeetual 63] tlte
aolmowledyz'ny of every qood thing] which is in you in Christ
Jesus ; that is, that thou mayest attain all virtue, that nothing
may be deficient. For so saith becomes effectual, when it is
accompanied with works. For withoutworlcssaitlz is dead. And
he has not said, Tkyfaith‚but‚ tlte communication (ff thysaitk,
connecting it with himself, and shewing that it is one body, .
and by this particularly making him ashamed to refuse. If
thou art a partaker, he sayS, with respect to the saith, thou
oughtest to communicate also with respect to other things.

Ver. 7. For we lzave ⁴areat joy and consolation in thy
love, because the bowels os the saints are reffivsked 63] tlzee,
brother. ,

Nothing so shames us into giving, as to bring forward the ¹
kiudnesses bestowed on others, and particularly when a man
is more entitled to respect than they. And he has not said,
⁶ If you do it to otherS, much more to me3’ but he has insi-
nuated the same thing, though he has contrived to do it in
another and a more gracious manner. ’

We kavejoy, that is, thou hast given me confidence from
the things which thou hast done to others, And consolation,
that is, we arc not only gratified, but we are also comforted.
For they are members of us. If then there ought to be such
an agreement, that in the refreshing of any others who are in
affliction, though we obtain nothing, we should be delighted
