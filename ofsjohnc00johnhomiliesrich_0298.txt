272 Clearacter of Titus, Matier and date oftlae Epistle.

Tuus of him in the Acts⁸. Perhaps he was a Corinthian, unless

1, 1-4. there was some other of the same name. And he summons

'11:33, Zenas, and orders Apollos to be sent to him, never Titus.
For he also attests their superior virtue and courage in the
presence of the Emperor.

Some time seems to have since elapsed, and Paul, when
he wrote this Epistle, appears to have been at liberty. For
he says nothing about his trials, but dwells continually upon
the grace of God, as being a sufficient encouragement to
believers to persever-e in virtue. For to learn what they had
deserved, and to what state they had been transferred, and
that by grace, and what had been vouchsafed them, was no
little encouragement. He takes aim also against the Jews,
and if he censures the whole nation, we need not wonder, for 1

Gal-3,l·he does the same in the case of the Galatiam, saying, Ο ³
foolz'sh Galatiam. And this does not proceed from a cen-
sorious temper, but from affection. For if it were done for
his own sake, one might fairly blame him3 but if from the
fervour of his zeal for the Gospel‚ it was not done reproach-
fully. Christ t00, on many occasions, reproached the Scribes

and PhariseeS, not 011 his own account, but because they
were the ruin of all the rest.

And he writes a short Epistle, with good reason, and this
is a proof of the virtue of Titus, that he did not require
many wordS, but a short remembrance. But this Epistle
seems to have been written before that to Timothy, for that
he wrote as near his end and in prison, but here, as fiee and

Tit. 3> at liberty. For his saying, I have determined to winter at
12. Nicopoli& is a proof that he was not yet in bondS, as when
he wrote to Timothy.

Ver. 1. Paul, a servant qs God, and an Apostle of Jesus
Christ, accordinq to lhefaz'lll of God's elect.

You observe how he uses these expressions indifferently,
sometimes calling himself the servant qf God, and sometimes
the servant Qf Christ, thus making 110 difference between the
Father and the Son.

Accordinq to the saith, of God's elect, and tlte aelmow-

 

⁸ In the vulgate, Acts 18, 7. there name. In the Syriae, which St. Chxy-

is mention of Titus, sarnamed Justus, sostom might know, Titus stands for
at Corinth, and a few MSS. have the Justus. ’
