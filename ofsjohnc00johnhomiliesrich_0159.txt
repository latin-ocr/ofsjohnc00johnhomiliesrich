honoured above all otherS, who more than others gives him-
¹‚2 self up to such labours? For he is exposed to numberless
ν tongues. One censures him, another praises him, a third
ss mocks him, another finds fault with his memory and his com-
position, and it requires great strength of mind to endure all
s this. It is an important point, and contributes much to the
’ edification of the Church, that the rulers of it should be apt to
teach. If this be wanting, many things in the Church go to
ruin. Therefore in addition to the qualifications of hospitality,
moderation, and a blameless life, he enumerates this aISO, say-
ing, Apt to teach. For why else indeed is he called a teacher?
Some say that he may teach philosophy by the example of his
life, so that all else is superfluous, and there is no need of verbal
instruction in order to proficiency. But why then does Paul
s say, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine?
For when doctrines are concerned, what life will answer the
purpose? And of what word is he speaking? Not of
3 pompous language, nor of discourse set off with external‘
ἶ. decorationS, but that which possesses the mighty power of
ἓ the spirit, and abounds with wisdom and understanding. It
v needs not set phraseS, but thoughts to give it utterance, not
skill in composition, but power of mind.

May we then receive an accusation against a younger man,
·, or against any one at all without witnesses? Ought we not
in all cases to come to our judgments with the greatest
- exactness? What then does he mean? Do not sc, he meanS,
v* with any, but especially in the case of an elder. For he
2- speaks of an elder not with respect to office, but to age,
· since the young more easily fall into sin than their elders.
And it is manifest from hence that the Church, and even
the whole people of Asia, had been now intrusted to Timothy,
which is the reason why he discourses with him conceming
elders.
