Ver. 20. Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimae have
I left at Mletum sielc.

This Trophimus and 'I'ychicus² we know from the book of

 

the Acts, sailed away with him from J udea, and were every
‘where his companionS, perhaps as being more zealous than
the rest.

Trophimae I have left at Miletum Sielc. Why then didst
thou not heal him, instead of leaving him? The Apostles
could not do every thing, or they did not dispense miraculous
gifts upon all occasionS, lest more should be ascribed to
them than was right. The same thing is observable of those
blessed and righteous men, who were before them, as in the
case of Moses, whose voice was weak. Why was not this

have been affected towards him if he had brought them also
into the Land of Promise? If he had not been suffered to be
overpowered by the sear of Pharaoh, would they not have
thought him a God? We see that the people of Lystra were
thus affected in the case of Paul and BarnabaS‚ thinking

among the people‚ crying out and saying, Sirs, why do ye Acts 14,
these chiny-9? we also are men of like passions with you. 14. ¹⁵·
Peter, again, when he had healed the man lame from his
birth, when all were amazed at the miracle‚ answered and
said, Ye men Qf Israel, why marvel ye at this, or why Acts 3,
look ye 80 earnestly on ue, as thouyh by our own power12·
or holiness we had made this man to walle? Hear also
the blessed Paul, saying, There was yiven to me a thorn2c0r,
in the flesh, lest I should be exalted above measure. Butm’ ⁷·
