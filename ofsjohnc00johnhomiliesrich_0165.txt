Union of Man with God in Chr ist. 139

’ Me, by imparting of that is thine to the good and the evil. ΗοΜ.
· When mocked, I bear with it, and do good to those XV.
who mock·Me: do thou imitate Me, as thou eanst. I
do good, not to be requited, do thou imitate Me, and do
good, not to be repaid. I have lighted luminaries in the
heavenS. Do thou light others brighter than these, for thou
canst, b y enlightening those that are in error. For to know
Me is a greater benefit than to behold the sun. Thou canst
not create a man, but thou canst make him just and accept-
ableto God. I formed his substance, do thou beautify his
will. See how I love thee, and have given thee the power
in the greater thingS.

Beloved, see how we are honoured! yet some are so un-
reasonable and so ungrateful as to say, ‘Why are we
endowed with free will?' But how in all the particulars
which we have mentioned could we have imitated God, if
there had been no free will? Ι rule AngeIS, He says, and so
dost thou, through Him who is the First-f1uits.1 sit on al Cor
royal throne, and thou art seated with Me in Him who is ¹⁵ 23
the First-fruits. As it is said, He lzatlz raised us up toyetloer Ephes-
and made us sit toqether in keavenly places in Christ JeSuS. 2² 9⁸
Through Him who is the F iret-fruits, Cherubim and Seraphim
adore thee, with all the heavenly host, principalities and
powerS, thrones and dominions. Disparage not thy body,
to which such high honours appertain, that the unbodied
Powers tremble at it.

But what shall I say? It is not in this way only that I
have shewn My love to thee, but by what I have suffered.
For thee I was spit upon, I was scourged. I emptied myself
of glory, I left My Father and came to thee, who dost hate
Me, and turn from Me, and art loth to hear My Name.

I pursued thee, Ι ran aster thee, that I might overtake thee.
I united and joined thee to myself, ‘ eat Me, drink Me,’ I
said. Above I hold thee, and below Ι embrace thee. Is it
ξ not enough for thee that I have thy F irst-fmits above ? Doth
³ not this satisfy thy affec-tion? I deseended below: 1 not
only am mingled with thee, Ῐ am entwined in thee. I am
masticatedl, broken into minute particleS, that the inter-meos&
spersion ², and commixture, and union may be more complete. ἕῳ

Things united remain yet in their own limitS, but Ι am σενακρω,
