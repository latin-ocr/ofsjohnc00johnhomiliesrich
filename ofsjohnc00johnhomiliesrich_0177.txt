 

We want here only what we ean use here. 151

For nature came naked into the world, and naked she will go Hom,
out of it. Therefore we want no superfluities3 if we brought LXVII.
v nothing with ηε, and shall take nothing away with uS.

Ver. 8. And hainnyfood ancl nument, let us be therewith
content.

Such things, and so much ought we to eat, as will suffice
⁴ to nourish US, and such things should we put on, as will
⁷ cover ηε, and clothe our nakedneSS, and nothing more 3 and
a common garment will answer this purpose. Then he urges

them from the consideration of things here, saying,
Ver. 9. But they that will be rich ; not those that are rich, (2)

¹ but those >who wish to be. For a man may have money and
⁴ make a good use of it, not overvaluing it, but bestowing it upon
' the poor. Such therefore he does not blame, but the covetous.
χ They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare,
and into manyfoolz'sh and Imrfful lustS, which drown men
in destruction and perdition.
‹ He has justly said, they drowa men, since they cannot be
ἐ raised from that depth. In destruction and perdition.

Ver. 10. For the love of money is the ‘root of all evil ;
which while some coveted after, they have erred from tlze
saith, and piereecl themselves throuyh with many sorrow-3.

Two things he mentions, and that which to them might
seem the more weighty he places last, their many sorrows.
And to learn how true this is, the only way is to sojourn with
the rich, to see how many are their sorrOWS, how bit-ter their

complaints,
Ver. 11. But thou, O man of God.

This is a title of great dignity. For we are all men of
, God, but the righteous peculiarly s0, not by right of creation
only, but by that of appropriation¹. If then thou art a man os ¹ οἵκυῶ·
’ G'od, seek not superfluous things, which lead thee not to God, ’Μ’
but

Flee these tltinys, and follow after riyhteousueSS. Both
expressions are emphati03 he does not say turn from one, and
approach the other, butflee these thinqs? pursue riqhteous-
nes-3, so as not to be covetOUS.

Godliness, that is, soundness in doctrines d.
’ Faz'tlz, which is opposed to questionings.
