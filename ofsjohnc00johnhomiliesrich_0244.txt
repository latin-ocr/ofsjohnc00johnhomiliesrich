Ver. ⁶22. Flee also youtliful lusis.

Not only the lust of fornication, but every inordinate
desire is a youthful lust. Let the aged learn that they ought
not to do the deeds of the youthful. If one be given to
insolenee, or a lover of power, os riches, of bodily pleasure,

grounded, but in a wavering state. What then does he κ
advise in order that none may be captivated by these things?

but only as far as lies in γοα, be peaeeable.
