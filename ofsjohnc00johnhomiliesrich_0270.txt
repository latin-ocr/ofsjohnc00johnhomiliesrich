2 Tm. suffer thee to have any foolish feeling, such as most men
3' 14. have. For he who knows the Scriptures as he ought, is not
(4) offended at any thing that happens3 he endures all things
mansully, referring them partly to saith, and to the incom-
prehensible nature of the divine dispensation‚ and partly
knowing reasons for them, and finding examples in the
Scriptures. Since it is a great sign of knowledge not to be
curious about every thing, nor to wish to know all things.
And if you will allow me, Ι will explain myself by an
example. Let us suppose a river, or rather riverS, (I ask no
allowanee, Ι only speak of what rivers really are,) all are not
of the same depth. Some have a shallow bed, others one
deep enough to clrown one unaequainted with it. In one
part there are whirlpools, and not in another. It is good
therefore to forbear to make trial of all ⁰, and it is no small
proof of knowledge not to wish to sound all the depths:
whereas he that would venture on every part of the river, is
really most ignorant of the peculiar nature of riverS, and will
often be in danger of perishing, from venturing into the
deeper parts with the same boldness with which he crossed
the shaHOWS. So it is in the things of God. He that will
know all thingS, and ventures to intrude into every thing,
he it is ‘that is most ignorant what God is. And of rivers
indeed, the greater part is safe‚ and the depths and whirl-
pools feW, but with respect to the things of God, the 'greater
part is hidden, and it is not possible to trace out His workS.
Why then art thou bent on drowning thyself in those
depths? ,

Know this, however, that God dispenses all thingS, that
He provides for all, that we are free agentS, that some things
He works, and some things He permits3 that He wills nothing
evil to be done3 that all things are not done by His will, but
some by ours also 3 all evil things by ours alone, all good
things by our will conjointly with His influence3 and that
nothing is without His knowledge. Therefore He worketh
all things ἢ Thou then knowing this canst reckon what

⁰ Instead of, ‘ It is good,’ &c- one as even to cause the destruction of
MS. has, ‘So also of the questions those who are too ouriously eager to
concerning God, some are such as to get knowledge.'
present a solution at once to the en· f i. e. Even what He permits is, to
quirer‚ but others so secret and hidden, us, His appointment.
