Here he has not omitted even the slaves. For he knew Hou-
that often even the words of slaves have power to overthrow Ι·
their master3 and more especially when his request was in
’ behalf of a slave. And perhaps it was they particularly who
exasperated him. He does not suffer them therefore to fall
into envyb, having honoured them ΒΥ including them in a
salutation with their masters. And neither does he allow
the master to take offence. For if he had made mention of
them ΒΥ name, perhaps he would have been angry. And if
he had not mentioned them at all, he ⁰ might have been dis-
pleased. Observe therefore how prudently he has found 3
= way by his manner of mentioning them, both to honour
ἰ them by his mention of them, and not to wound him. For
’ the name of the Clturch does not suffer masters to be angry,
even though they are reckoned together with their servants.
For the Church knows not the distinction of master and
servant. By good actions and ΒΥ sins she defines the one
and the other. If then it is a Church, be not displeased
that thy slave is saluted with thee. For in Christ Jesus Gal. 3,
there is neither hond nor free. ²8·

membrance. Consider, he says, how great things God has
pardoned in thee, how by grace thou art saved. Imitate thy
Lord. And he prays for peace to him; and naturally: for
it comes then when we imitate Him, then grace abides.
Since even that servant who was unmerciful to his fellow·
servants, until he demanded the hundred peuce, had the
grace of his master abiding on him. But when he made
that demand, it was taken from him, and he was delivered to
the tormentorS.

Considering these thingS, then, let us also be merciful and Motu..
forgiving towards those who have trespassed against us, (2)
The offences against us here are a hundred peuce, but those
from us against God are ten thousand talents. But you
know that offences are also judged by the quality of the
