f thou also wilt not be ashamed of him. By calling him his Hom.
son, he hath shewn his natural affection3 and by calling him -Hss—
his brother, his great good will for him, and his equality in
honour.

These things are not written without an object, but that Momm.

we masters may not despair of our servants, nor press too (3)
hard on them, but may learn to pardon the offences of such
servants, that we may not be always severe, that we may not
from their servitude be ashamed to make them partakers with
us in all things when they are good. For if Paul was not
ashamed to call one lzis son, leis own boweIS, his brother,
his beloved, surely we ought not to be ashamed. And why
do I say Paul? The Master of Paul is not ashamed to call
our servants His own brethren3 and are we ashamed? See
how He honours us3 He calls our servants His own brethren‚
friends, and fellow-heirs. See to what He has descended!
What therefore having done, shall we have accomplished our
whole duty? We shall never in any wise do it 3 but to what-
, ever degree of humility we have come, the greater part of it is
still left behind. For consider, whatever thou doest, thou
doest to a fellow-servant, but thy Master hath done it to
thy servants. Hear and shudder! Never be elated at thy
humility!

Perhaps you laugh at the expression, as if humility could
puff up. But be not surprised at it, it puffs up, when it is
not genuine. How, and in what manner? When it is prac-
tised to gain the favour of men, and not os God, that we may
be praised, and be high-minded. For this also is diabolical.

For as many are vain-glorious on account of their not
÷ being vain-gloriousi, so are they elated on account of their

humbling themselveS, by reason of their being high-minded.

³ For instance, a brother has come, or even a servant

thou hast received him, thou hast washed his feet3 im-
mediately thou thinkest highly of thyself. I have done,
thou sayest, what no other has done. I have achieved
humility. How then may any one continue in humility?
