1⁹ 11. tell me, to be gazed at by a multitude ? It is vainglory, and κη

nothing else. For return to thy house, and to solitude, and ³
immediately all is gone. Thou hast gone to the market·
place, thou hast turned upon thee the eyes of all present.
What hast thou gained? Nothing. It vanished, and passed

away like dissolving smoke. Do we then love things thus -ῑ

unsubstantial? How unreasonable is this! what madness!

To one thing only let us look, to the praise of God. If this

be our object, we shall never seek the praise of men3 but if

it falls to uS, we shall despise, deride, and reject it. We shall

be affected as those who desire gold, but receive clay. Let

not any one praise thee, for it profits nothing-‘3 and if he

blame thee, it harms thee not. But with God praise and

blame are attended with real gain and losS, whilst all is vain

that proceeds from men. And herein we are made like imto

{3³1¹ss 5, God, that He needs not glory from men. I receive not, said

⁶ Christ, honour from men. Is this then a light thing, tell

me? When thou art unwilling to despise glory, say, ‘ By

despising it, I shall resemble God,’ and immediately thou

wilt despise it. But it is impossible that the slave of glory

should not be a slave to all, more servile than slaves in

reality. For we do not impose upon our slaves such task8‚

as glory exacts from her captives. Base and shameful are

the things she makes them say, and do ¹¹¹, and suffer, and

when she sees them obedient, she is the more urgent in her

commands.

Let us fly then, I enti-eat you, let us fly from this slavery. ,

dream, a shadOW‚ and nothing better3 we shall easily over-

come this desire, and neither in little nor in great things shall

be led captive by it. But· if in little things we do not 2

despise it, we shall easily be overcome by it in the most 3

important. Let us therefore remove far from us the sources 1}

of it, and these are, folly, and meanness of mind, so that, if ⁴

we assume a lofty spirit, we shall be able to look beyond ¹
