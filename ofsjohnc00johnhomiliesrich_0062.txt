36 How to ylorify God* in our body and our spirit.

To Him be honour and *olor-essm· ever. Amen.

Now honour and glory are not mere words; and since He
has honoured us not by words only, but by what He has done
for ηε, so let us honour Him by works and deeds, Yet this
honour touches US, while that reaches not Him, for He needs
not the honour that comes from us, we do need that which is
from Him.

In honouring Him, therefore, we do honour to ourselveS.
He who opens his eyes to gaze on the light of the sun, receives
delight himself, as he admires the beauty of the star, but does
no favour to that luminary‚ norincreases its splendour,for it con-

He who admires and honours God does so to his own salva-
tion, and highest benefit3 and how ? Because he follows after
virtue, and is honoured by Him. For tloem llzat honour Me,
He says, I will honour. How then is He honoured, if He
enjoys no advantage from our honour? Just as He is said to
hunger and thirst. For He assumes every thing that is
ours, that He may in any wise attract us to Him. He is
said to receive honourS, and even insultS, that we may
be afraid. But with all this we are not attracted towards
Him ἱ

and in our spirit. And how is one to glorify Him in the
body ? saith one, and how in the spirit? The soul is here called
the spirit to distinguish it from the body. But how may we
glorify Him in the body and in the spirit? He glorifies Him
in the body, who does not commit adultery or fornication,
who avoids gluttony and drunkenneSS, who does not affect
a shewy exterior, who makes such provision for himself as
is sufficient for health only: and so the woman, who does not ’
perfume nor paint her person, but is satisfied to be such as
God made her, and adds no. device of her own. For why ’
dost thou add thy own embellishments to the work which .
God made? Is not His workmanship sufficient for thee? or
dost thou endeavour to add grace to it, as if forsooth thou wert
