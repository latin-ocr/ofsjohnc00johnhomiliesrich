HOMILY XI.

 

1 Tm. iii. 8, 9, 10.

Likewisc must the deacons be yrave, not doubletonyued, not
given to m'uolz wine, not yreedy of filtky lucre ,- holding]
the mystery of tlte saith in a pure conscience. And let
these also first be proved: then Zet them use the office of a

4:¹ss between Presbyters and Bishops there was no great differ-
ence. Both had undertaken the office of Teachers and
’ἶ Presidents in the Church, and what he has said concerning
’ Bishops is applicable to Presbyters. For they are only
’ζ’ superior in having the power of ordination, and seem to have
no other advantage over PresbyterS.

Likewise tlze dcacom. That is, they should have the same
‘sl-j, qualities as Bishops. And what are these same. To be blame-

And that he means this when he says likewise, is evident
from what he says in addition, yrave, not doubletonyued;

man as deceit, nothing is so pernicious in the Church as
insincerity. Not yiven io much wine, not yreedy offiltley
