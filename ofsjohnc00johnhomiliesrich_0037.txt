house, should be careful to make it magnificent, but bestow Hom.
not a thought upon his household. But who preserves the 1.
succession of the seasons? Who established the regular
laws of nature? Who appointed the courses of day
and night? These things are superior to any such nati-
vity. ‘ But these,’ you say, ⁶ came to be of themselves? And
yet, how can such a well-ordered system spring up of itself ?

‘ But whence,’ you say, ‘ come the rich, the healthy‚ the re-
nowned, and how are some made rich by covetousneSS, some
by inheritance‚ some by violence? and why does God suffer
the wicked to be prosperous ?’ We answer, Because the
retribution, according to the desert of each, does not take
place here, but is reserved for hereafter. Shew me any such
thing taking place Then ! ‘ Well‚’ say you, ‘ give me here, and
I do not look for hereafter.’ But it is because you seek here, Comp.
that you' receive not. For if when earthly enjoyment is {ages
not within your mach, you seek present things so eagerly as
³ to prefer them to future, what would you do if you were in pos-
session of unmixed pleasure? God therefore shews you that
these things are nothing, and indifferent ; for if they were not
indifferent, He would not bestow them on such men. You will
own that it is a matter of indifference whether one be tall or
short, black or white3 so is it whether one be rich or poor. For,
tell me, are not things necessary bestowed on all equally, as
the capacity for virtue, the distribution of spiritual gifts? If
you understood aright the mercies of God, you would not
complain of wanting worldly things, whilst you enjoyed these
best gifts equally with others; and knowing that equal dis-
tribution, you would not desire superiority in the rest. As if
a servant enjoying from his master’s bounty food, clothing‚ and
lodging,<and all other necessaries equally with his fellow
servantS, should pride himself upon having longer naiIS, or

. more hair upon his head3 so it is for a Christian to be elated

on account of those things, which he enjoys only for a time.
For this reason it is, that God withdraws those things from
us, to extinguish this madness, and transfer our affections
from them to heaven. But nevertheless we do not learn
wisdom. As if a child possessing a toy, should prefer it to
things necessary, and his father, to lead him against his will
to what was better for him, should deprive him of his toy3 so
