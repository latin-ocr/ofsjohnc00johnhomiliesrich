6 St. Paul's love sor Timothy. His severity to some.

1 Tm· and in many other things they may- be like or unlike, but there
¹⁹ 2⁹ is no such dissimilarity in the divine Essence. By command-
ment. This is a stronger expression than ‘ called,’ as we leam
from other passages, As he here calls Timothy mine own
son, in like manner he says to the Corintfflans, in Christ
Jesus I have beyotten you, i. e. in faith3 but he adds the word
'ww-⁹ own ¹, to shew his particular likeness to himself, as well as his
own love and great affection for him. Notice again the in
applied to the saith. My own son, he sayS, in thefaitlz. See
what an honourable distinction, in that he calls him not only

his son, but his own son.
Ver. 2. Graee, mercy, and peaeefrom God our Fatlzer and

Jesus Christ our Lord.

(⁶2) Why is mercy mentioned here, and not in the other Epis-
tles? This is a further mark of his affection. Upon his son

 

he invokes greater blessingS, with the anxious apprehension ⁴·

of a parent. For such was his anxiety‚ that he gives direc-

indeed stand more in need of mercy.

From God our Fatker, he sayS‚ aad Jesus Christ our Lord.

Here too is consolation. For if God is our Father‚ He cares

Ver. 3. As I besouyht thee to abide stillat Ephesust, when
I went into Macedonia.

Observe the gentleness of the expression, more like that of a
servant than of a master. For he does not say ‘ I commanded,’
or ‘ bade‚' or even ‘ exhorted‚' but I besouyht thee. But this
tone is not for all: only meek and virtuous disciples are to be
treated thus. The corrupt and insincere are to be dealt with
in a different manner, as Paul himself elsewhere directS‚

'lsgt- 2, Rebulce them with all authority; and here he says chame, not
' ‘ beseech‚' but chao-qe some that they teach uo other doctrine.
What means this? That Paul’s Epistle which he sent them was

not sufficient? Nay, it was sufficient; but men are apt some-

times to slight EpistleS‚ or perhaps this may have been before

the Epistles were written. He had himself passed some time

in that city. There was the temple of Diana, and there he

had been exposed to those great sufferings. For after the
