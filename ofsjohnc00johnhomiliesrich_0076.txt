amined and chastised with blows, they are frightened to
death, and if one of their companions strikes them, and that
severely, they cannot have while to be angry, nor complain
to their master3 so is their soul possessed with sear. They
only look to one thing, that they may go in and come out
without stripes, and their thoughts are on that time. And
when they come out, whether beaten or not, the blows they
have received from their playsellows never enter their minds
for the delight. And you, when you stand anxiously con-
cemed for your own sinS, how can you but shudder at
making ¹mention of others' faults⁰? How can you implore
pardon of God? For your own case is made worse on the
terms of your imprecations against another, and you forbid
Him to make allowance for your own faults. . Might He not
say, “ If thou wouldest have Me so severe in exacting offences
against thee, how canst thou expect Me to pardon thy
offences against Me ?” Let us learn at last to be Christians ἱ

‚forgiveness and forgetting of offences against us. Beinq

reviled, it is said, we bless‚· beinq persecuted, we suffer it,-

not this sin to their clearye. Instead of praying against
them, he prayed for them. You, instead of praying for them,
utter imprecations against them. You then are wicked in
the degree that he was excellent. Whom do we admire, tell

me3 those for whom he prayed, or him who prayed for them? ’

Him certainly! and if we, much more then God. Would you
have your enemy stricken? pray for him: yet not with such
intention, not to strike him. That will indeed be the effect,
but let it not be your object. That blessed martyr suffered
all unjustly, yet he prayed for them: we suffer many things
justly from our enemies. And if he who suffered unjustly
durst not forbear to pray for his enemieS, what punishment
