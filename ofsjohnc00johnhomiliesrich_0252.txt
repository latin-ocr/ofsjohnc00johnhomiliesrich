‘226 Alms avail 770! unless they are of our own.

2 Tm. God offers us for sale, but He would sell us the latter rather
2'¹3'18'than the former⁴ Why do we complain, like silly children,
that we receive the more preciousq? Is it possible then to
purchase life for money? YeS, when what we bestow is our
own, and not the property of another3 when we do not

 

practise an imposture. But, you say, henceforth the goods
are mine. They are not thine after rapine. They are still
thy neighbour's‚ though thou wert a thousand times the
master of them. For if thou shouldest receive a deposit‚ it
would not be thine own even for the short season that the
depositor was tramlling, though it might be laid up with
thee. If therefore that is not ours, which we received with
the consent and thanks of those who deposited it, even for
the short period that we retain it, much less is that ourS,
which we plundered against the will of its owner. He is the
master of it, however long thou mayest withhold it. But
Virtue is Γ really our own3 as for money, even our own is not
strictly oum, much less that of others. To-day it is oum, to-
morrow it belongs to another. What is of virtue is our own l
possession. This does not suffer loss, like other thingS‚ but
is entirely possessed by all who have it. This therefore let
us acquire, and let us despise riches, that we may be able to
attain those real goodS‚ of which God grant that we may be
thought worthy to partake, through the grace and loving-
kindneSS, διο.
