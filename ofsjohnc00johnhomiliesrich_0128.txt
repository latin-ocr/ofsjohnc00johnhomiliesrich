4, ,θ’ Other things then (as we have said) He hath made common,
as hams, citieS, market-placeS, walks. And observe‚ that
concerning things that are common there is no contention,
but all is peaceable. But when one attempts to possess him-
self of any thing, to make it his own, then contention is intro-
duced, as if nature herself were indignant, that when God
brings us together in every way, we are eager to divide and
separate ourselves by appropriating thingS‚ and by using
those cold words ‘ mine and thine.' Then there is conten·
tion and uneasiness. But where this is not, no strife or con-
tention is bred. This state therefore is rather our inheritance‚
and more agreeable to nature. Why is it, that there is never
a dispute about a market place? Is it not because it is com-

always disputing. Things necessary are set before us in

But as I said, how can he, who is rich, be a good man?
When he distributes his richeS‚ he is good, so that he is good

but whilst he keeps it himself, he is not good. How then is
that a good which being retained renders men evil, being
parted with makes them good? Not therefore to have
wealth‚ but to have it not, makes one appear to be good.
'Wealth therefore is not a good. But if, when you can
receive it, you receive it not, again you are good.

If then we are good, when having it, we distribute it to
others; or when offered to us we refuse it, and if we are
not good, when we receive or gain it, how can it be a good
thing in itself? Call it not therefore a good. You possess
it not, because you think it a good, because you are anxious
to possess it. Cleanse thy mind, and rectify thy judgment‚
and then thou wilt be good. Learn what are really goods.
What are they? Virtue and benevolence. These and not
that, are truly good. According to this rule, the more
