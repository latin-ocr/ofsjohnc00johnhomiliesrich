3³< Ver. l. The elder women as mother-9, the younyer men as
brethren ,· the younyer women as sisterS, with all purity.
Rebuke is in its own nature offensive, particularly when it
5&fiis addressed to an oldman, and when it proceeds from a
ξ young man too, there is a threesold shew of forwardness. By
