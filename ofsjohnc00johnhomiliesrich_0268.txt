he escape it who is treading in the strait and narrow way,
and who has heard, thatin tlze world με shall have tribula-
tion ‚P If Job in his time said, lee life (ff man upon earth
is a state of trial ; how much more was it so in those days?

Ver. 13. But evil men and seduc-ers sltall wax worse and

⁸ worse, deceivinq, and beiny deceived.

Let none of these thingS, he sayS, disturb thee, if they are
in prosperity, and thou in triaIS. Such is the nature of the
case. From my own instance thou mayest learn that it is
impossible for man, in his warfare with the wicked, not to
be exposed to tribulation. One cannot be in combat and
live luxuriously, one cannot be wrestling and feasting. Let
none therefore of those who are contending seek for ease or
joyous living, Again, the present state is contest, warfare,
tribulation, straits, and triaIS, and the very scene of conflicts.
The season for rest is not now, this is the time for toil and
labour. No one who has just stripped and anointed himself
thinks of ease. If thou thinkest of ease, why didst thou

' strip, or prepare to sight? ⁶ But do Ι not maintain the fight ?‘

Ps.37,1.

you say. What, when thou dost not conquer thy desireS, ³
nor resist the evil bias of nature ?

Ver. 14. But continue thou in the thinqs that thou least
learned and least been assared of, knowiny of whom thou
hasc learned {laem ; And that from a child thou least known
tlte holy ScriptureS, which are able to make thee wise anto
salvation 'throuyhfaith which is in Christ Jesus.

What is this? As the prophet David exhorted, saying,
*Re not thou envions ayainst tlte worlcers of iniquity? so
Paul exhortS, Continue thoa in the tletinys which thoa least
learned, and not simply learned, but least been assared Qf,
that is, hast believed. And what have I believed? That this
is, the Life. And if thou seest things happening contrary to
thy belief, be not troubled. The same happened to Abraham,
yet he was not affected at it. He had heard, In Isaac shall
tlely seed be ealled; and he was commanded to sacrifice
Isaac, yet he was not troubled nor dismayed. Let no one
be offended because of the wicked. This the Scripture
taught from the beginning.

that then, if the good be in prosperity, and the wicked
be punished? The one is likely to happen, the other not so.-
