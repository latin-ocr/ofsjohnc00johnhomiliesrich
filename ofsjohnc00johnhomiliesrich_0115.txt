In keeping this mystery, then, let us be faithful to our Hom.

·ss’'. trust. So great a mystery has He entrusted to uS, and *X 1.

3 we do not trust Him even with our money, though He Mzgr.
has bid us lay up our wealth with Him, where none can

take it away, neither can moth nor thief waste it. And

ἒξ· He promises to repay us a hundred-sold, yet we obey Him

not. Yet here if we entrust any with a deposit, we receive

’“ nothing back in addition, but are thankful if that is restored

,ᾗ which we deposited. Ι f a thies steals it there, He saith, set

32 that to My account 3 I say not to thee, a thies has taken it,

ἶ or moth devoured it. He repays a hundred-sold here, and
eternal life is superadded hereafter, yet do we not lay up

our treasure there! ‘ But: you say, ‘ He repays slowly.’ Well

this too is a proof of the greatness of His gift, that He does

J not repay here in this morta] life3 or rather He does repay

even here'a hundred-sold. For did not Paul leave here his
tools¹, Peter his rod and hook, and Matthew his seat of cus- 'calanu-
’“ tom? and was not the whole world opened to them more

εἴ than to kings? Were not all things laid at their feet? Were

they not appointed rulers2, and lords? Did not men com-wam-
mit their lives into their hands? suspend themselves wholly τὰς·

j upon their counsel, and enlist in their service? And do we

not see many similar occurrences even now? Many men of

ᾗ, poor and humble means, who did but handle the spade, and

had hardly a sufficiency of necessary food, having but the

character of monkS, have been celebrated above all men, and
honoured of kings.

Are these things inconsiderable? Well, consider that
Ἰ these are but additions, the principa] sum is stored up
for the life to come. Despise richeS, if thou wouldest have
”,· riches. ·If thou wouldest be truly rich, become poor. For
ζ such are the paradoxes of God. He would not have thee
rich from thy own care, but from His grace. Leave these
things to Me, He says; make spiritual things thy concern,
that thou mayest know My power. Flee from that yoke of
slavery, which riches impose. As long as thou cleavest to
them, thou art poor. When thou despisest them, thou art
doubly rich, in that such things shall ssow in upon thee from

   

 

which all know, yea rather which all made manifest to all!
