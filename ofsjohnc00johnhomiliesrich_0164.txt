138 Public buildinys. Mem yz'fted wilh creative power.

1 ΤιΜ. Nay, sometimes things decayed by time stand firm under the
δ’ ²⁰⁶ shock of an earthquake, whilst glittering edificeS, firmly
fixed, and newly constructed, are struck but by lightning
and perish. And this, Ι believe, is the interposition of God,

that we may not take pride in our buildings,
Would you again have another ground for cheerfulness?
Go to the public buildingS, in which you share equally with
others. For the most magnificent private houseS, after all,
are less splendid than the public edifices. There you may
remain, as long as you please. They belong to you as much
as to otherS‚ since they are common to you with others; they
are common, and not private. But those, you say, delight
you not. They delight you not, partly because you are
familiar with thern, and partly from your covetousneSS. So
the pleasantness is not in the beauty, but in the appropriating!
So the pleasure is in greedineSS, and in the wish to make
every man's goods your own! How long are we to be nailed
to these things? How long are we to be fastened to the earth,

 

and grovel, like wormS, in the dirt? God hath given us a
body of earth, that we might carry it with us up to heaven, not
that we should draw our soul down with it to earth. Earthy
it is, but if we please, it may be heavenly. See how highly
God has honoured us, in committing to us so excellent a
frame. I made heaven and earth, He sayS, and to you Ι give ’
the power of creation. Make your earth heaven. For it· is
Amos 5‚in thy power. I am He that maketh. and tranfformetlz all
S’LXX‘tlziozys, saith God of Himself. And He hath given to men a
similar power 3 as a painter,being an affectionate father, teaches
his own art to hi's son. Ι formed thy body beautiful,he sayS,
but I give thee the power of forming something better. Make
Gen. 1, thy soul beautiful. I said, Let tlte eartlz briny forth, yrass,
Π· and everysruifful tree. Do thou also say, Let this earthk
bring forth its proper fruit, and what thou willest to produce
Ps. 74, will be produced. l make the summer and the cloud. I
ἕξ, 104, create the lightning and the wind. Ι formed the dragon,
26. that is, the devil ¹, to make sport with him. Nor have I
grudged thee the like power. Thou, if thou wilt, canst sport
with him, and bind him as thou wouldest a sparrow. I make
the sun to rise upon the evil and the good: do thou imitate

1‘ i. e. the body. ¹ So St. Aug. on Ps. 103. Vulg. taking formed of his degradati'on.
