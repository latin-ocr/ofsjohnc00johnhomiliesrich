ι this carries us on, there will be little trouble. Many are in - 1
the habit of crossing¹ themselves confinually, and they need ζζφεανῖ·
no one to remind them of it, but often when the mind is
'12wandering after other things, the hand 1s inv oluntarily drawn

by custom‚ as by some living teacher, to make the sign.
Some have brought themselves into a habit of not swearing

at all, and therefore neither willingly nor unwillingly do they

ever do it. Let us then bring ourselves into such a habit of
almsgiving.

What labours were it worth to us to discover such a
remedy. For say, were there not the relies of almsgiving‚
’ while we still by our numberless sins rendered ourselves
liable to Divine vengeance‚ should we not have lamented
sadly? Should we not have said, O that it were possible by
Ὗ our wealth to wash away our sinS‚ and we would have parted
with it all! O that by our riches we could put away the

us power to buy off not temporal but eternal death. Do not
purchase, He, says, this short life, but that life that is ever-

nothing. 1 know the worth of that which I offer thee. The
bargainers and traffickers in worldy goods do not act thus.
They, when they can⁰ impose on whom they will, give a little
to receivea great deal. It is not so with God. He gives
the greater by far for the less,

Tell me, if you were to go to a merchant, and he were to
set before you two stones, one of little worth Ρ, and the other
very precious‚ and sure to fetch a large amount of wealth; if
he allowed you sor the price of the cheap one to carry off
the more cosssy, should you complain of him? No! Yon
would rather admire his liberality. So now, two lives are
set before ηε, the one temporal‚ the other eternal. These
