70 ›Silence in Oloura-h. Women not to teach.

conversing upon unprofitable subjects. Thus all is confusion,
and they seem not to understand, that unless they are
quiet, they cannot learn any thing that is useful. For when
our discourse strains against the talking, and no one minds
what is said, what good can it do to them? To such a degree
should women be silent, that they are not allowed to speak
not only about worldly matterS, but not even about spiritual
things, in the church. This is order, this is modesty, this
will adorn her more than any garments. Thus clothed, she
will be able to offer her prayers in the manner most be-

and wrought our ruin. Therefore because she made a bad .

use of her power over the man, or rather her equality with
him, God made her subject to her husband. Thy desire shall
be to thy husband. This had not been said to her‘before.
But how was Adam not deceived? If he was not deceived,
he did not then transgress? Attend carefully. The woman
said, lee serpent bequiled me. But the man did not say, The
woman deceived me, but, slze slave me of the tree, and Ι did
