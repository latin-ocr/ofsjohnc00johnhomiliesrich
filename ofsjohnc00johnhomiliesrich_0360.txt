Baptism. For that he obtained there the gift os Baptism is manifest
from his saying, Whom 1 have beqotten in my bonds. Paul there-
fore writes, recommending him to his master, that on every account ]
he should forgive him, and receive him as one now regenerate ⁰. Δ
But because some say, that it was superfluous that this Epistle ᾗ
should be annexed, since he is making a request about a small matter J
in behalf of one man, let them learn who make these objections, that
· they are themselves deserving of very many censures. For it was f
not only proper that these small Epistles, in behalf of things so ne· Α
cessary, should have been inscribed d, but I wish that it were possible ;
to meet with one who could deliver to us the history of the Apostles, ¹
not only all they wrote and spoke of, but of the rest os their con· ᾖ
versation, even what they ate, and when they ate, when they walked, i
and where they sat‘, what they did every day, in what parts they 2
were, into what house they entered, and where they lodgedf—to ῗ,
relate every thing with minute exactness, so replete with advantage is ¹
all that was done by them. But the greater part, not knowing the ³
benefit that would result thence, proceed to censure it.
For if only seeing those places where they sat or where they were ,
imprisoned, mere lifeless spots, we often transport our minds thither, fl
and imagine their virtue, and are excited by it, and become more
zealous‚ much more would this be the case, if we heard their words ⁴
and their other actions. But concerning a friend a man inquires,
where he lives, what he is doing, whither he is going: and say, should
we not make these inquiries ⁸ about these the general instructors of the ⁴
world? For when a man leads a spiritual life, the habit, the walk,
the words and the actions of such an one, in short, all that relates to
him, profits the hearers, and nothing is a hindrance or impediment.
But it is useful for you to learn that this Epistle was sent upon
necessary matters, Observe therefore how many things are rectified
thereby. We have this one thing first, that in all things it becomes
one to be earnest. For if Paul bestows so much concern upon a
run-away, a thies, and a robber, and does not refuse nor is ashamed
to send him back with such commendations3 much more does it
become us not to be negligent in such matters. Secondly, that we

this scote forgive him every thing. And e So B. and Ven. Edd. where they
so much for the argument. Now let us sat and when they walked.
