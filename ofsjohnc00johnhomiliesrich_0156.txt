5' 16. They naturally become idle, tattlerS, and busy-bodies. For
he who does not attend to his own concerns will be meddling
with those of otherS, even as he who minds his own business
will take no account of and have no care about the affairs of
another. And nothing is so unbecoming to a woman, as to
busy herself in the concerns of otherS, and it is¹ no less un-

occasion should be given to the adversary. Had nothing of
this kind taken place, he would not have forbidden them.

Ver. 16. If any man or woman that believetll have widOwS,
let them relieve them, and let not the Chare-h be charyecl,
that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

 

Observe how again he speaks of those as widows indeed,
who are left destitute, and have no resource from any other
quai-ter. It was better to have it so, For thus two 'great ob-
