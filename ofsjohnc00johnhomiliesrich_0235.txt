ο about words. To guard against this, he has not only Hon-
charged them not to strive about wordS, but to render his V.
’ discourse more alarming, he adds, to the subvertiny of the
hearers,

Ver. 15. Study to shew Chysegf approved unto God, a
workman that needeclc not to be ashamed, riqletly dividiny
the word of irath. ,

Every where this ‘ not being ashamed!’ And why is he
‘ ever so careful to guard him against shame? Because it was na—
tural for many to be ashamed both of Paul himself, as being a
tent-makerfgnd of the preaching, since its teachers pei-ished.
'For Christ Μ been crucified, himself was about to be
beheaded, Peter was crucified with his head downwardS, and
these things they'suffered from audacious and despicable
men. Because such men were in power, he says, ‘ Be not
ashamed? that is, sear not to do any thing tending to god·-
lineSS, though it be necessary to submit to slavery or any
other suffering. For how does any one become approved?
By being a workman that needetle, not to be ashamed. As
the workman is not ashamed of any work, so neither should
he be ashamed who labours in the Gospel. He should sub-
mit to any thing.

Riqhtly dividinq the word of irath.

This he hath well said. For many distort it, and pervert
¹ it in every way, and many additions are made to it. He has
not said directing it, but rightly dividirzy, that is, cut away
what is spuriouS, with much vehemence assail it, and
extirpate it. With the sword of the Spirit cut off from your
preaching, as from a thong, whatever is superfluous and
foreign to it.

Ver. 16.' And skzm profane novelties os speeclzb.

For they will not stop there. For when any thing new
has been introduced, it is ever producing innovationS, and
the error of him who has once left the safe harbour is infinite,

and never stops.
For they will increase unto more unyodlineSS, he sayS,

 

Ver. 17 . And their word will eat as· dom a canlcer.
It is an evil not to be restrained, not curable by any
medicine, it destroys the whole frame. He shews that
