PREFACE.

, ΤΗΕ remark of Photius, that St. Chrysostom’s more
finished works were those which he composed at Antioch,
does not seem to afford a sufficient criterion for assigning a
date 10 each set of Homilies. Tillemont appears to have been
misled by it 111 the instance of those 011 the Epistles to
Timothy, which he has on such grounds supposed to have
been delivered at Constantinople. Montfaucon however

l. That 118 speaks 11111011 of the Monks as he used to do
there, owing to the neighbourhood of a large number of
1118111, who lived 111 strict discipline and exemplary devotion.

‚That 111 speaking of Timothys office as Bishop, he never
says a word of being one himself. A third reason may be
added, which 18 perhaps more conclusive than either of these.
In Hom. viii. on 2 Tim. iii. he seems pretty evidently to

‘'J‘' allude to the buming of the Temple of Apollo at Daphne

‘3³ see Ρ. 247, note 11.Ἒᾶἷᾶἑῦ hardly dOUbt the allusion, in

reading the fi111 account in the Homily on St.Baby1as; nor
can it well be supposed that he would thus refer to it as a
thing well known at any other place than Antioch.

The Homilies 011 1118 ΕΡ18118 10 Titus are fixed at Antioch
by the mention of Daphne and the cave of Matrona in Hom.
iii. (2.) p. 295. A passage in Hom. i. (4.) Ρ. 279. seems to
place him in a paterna] relation to the people, as the plural
we is constantly used by him for the singular. But the
whole context seems rather to allude to another as Bishop‚
and he must be understood to speak as one of a body of

clergy, in which in fact he held the second place.
