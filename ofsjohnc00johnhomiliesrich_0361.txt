ought not to abandon the race of slaves, even if they have proceeded
⁴:toextreme wickedness. For if a thies and a run-away become so

much more ought we not to abandon the free. Thirdly, that we
’ἲ ought not to withdraw slaves from the service of their masters. For
if Paul, who had such confidence in Philemon, was unwilling to detain
γ Onesimus, so useful and serviceable to minister to himself, without
’ρ’ the consent of his master, much less ought we so to act. For if the
servant is so excellent, he ought by all means to continue in that
service, and to acknowledge the authority of his master, that he may
ξς be the occasion of benefit to all in that house. Why dost thou take
the candle from the candlestick to place it in the bushel?

I wish it were possible to bring into the cities those (servants) who

kj- *are without. ‘What,’ say you, ‘ if he also should become corrupt.'
js< And why should he, Ι beseech you Ρ Because he has come into the
city Ρ But consider, that being without he will be much more corrupt.
For he who is corrupt being within, will be much more so being
without. For here he will be delivered from necessary care, his mas—
ter taking that care upon himself 3 but there the concern about those
things will draw him off perhaps even from things more necessary,
and more spiritual. On this account the blessed Paul, when giving

them the best counsel, said, Art tltoa called, beinq a servant? care not {fon 7,

doctrine be not blasphemed. For the Gentiles also will say, that even

one who is a slave can be well pleasing to God. But now many are
reduced to the necessity of blasphemy‚ and of saying Christianity

has been introduced into life for the subversion of every thing,

masters having their servants taken from them, and it is a matter of

violence.
Let me also say one other thing. He teaches us not to be ashamed

mirable of men, speaks thus much in favour of this one, much more
should we speak favourably of ours. There being then so many
