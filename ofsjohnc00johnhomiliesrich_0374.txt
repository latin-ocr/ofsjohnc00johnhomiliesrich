348 Onesimus (ι son beyolien in bonds.

PH112· Paul, from the quality os his person, from his age, because he
1, 11. was old, and srom what was more just than all, because he
was also a prisoner of Jesas olm-ist.

For who would not receive with open arms a combatant
who had been crowned? Who, seeing him bound for Christ's
sake, would not have granted him ten thousand favours? By
so many considerations having previously soothed his mind,
he has not immediately introduced the name, but defers
making so great a request‚ For you know what are the minds ,

 

of masters towards slaves that have run away3 and particu-
larly when they have done this with robbery, even if they
have good masterS, how their anger is increased. This anger
then having taken all these pains to soothe, and having
first persuaded him readily to serve him in any thing what-
ever, and having prepared his soul to all obedience, then he
introduces his request‚ and sayS, 1 beseeclc thee, aud with the
addition of praises,sor my son wleom Ι have beyotten in my
bonds.

Again the chains are mentioned to shame him into com-
pliance, and then the name. F or he has not only ex-
tinguished his anger, but has caused him to be delighted.
For I would not have called him my son, he says, if he were
not especially profitable. What I called Timothy, that I
call him also· And repeatedly shewing his affection, he
urges him by the very period of his new birth, J have be-
qotten him in my bondS, he sayS, so that on this account also
he was worthy to obtain much honour, because he was begotten
in his very conflictS, in his trials in the cause of Christ. ³

Onesimus,

Ver. ll. W hic-le, in time past was to thee unprqfi'table.

See how great is his prudence, how he confesses the
man's faultS, and thereby extinguishes his anger. Ι know,
he sayS, that he was unprofitable.

But now he will be profltahle to thee and 10 me.

He has not said he will be useful to thee, lest he should
contradict it, but he has introduced his own person, that his
hopes may seem worthy of credit, But ηοω, he says, profit-
able to thee and to me. For if he was profitable to Paul,

who required so great strictness, much more would he be so
to his master.
