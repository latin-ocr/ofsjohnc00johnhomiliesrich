Ver. 7. Ι leave fouyht tlte 90οά fiylet, I have finis-hed my
course, I have kept ihesaz‘th.

Often, when Ι have taken the Apostle into my hands, and
have considered this passage, I have been at a loss to under-
stand why Paul here speaks so loftily: I have fouylzt the
90οά fiyltt. But now by the grace of God I seem to have
found it out. For what purpose then does he speak thus?

ὲ He is desirous to console the despondency of his disciple,

and therefore bids him be of good cheer, since he was going

to his crown, having finished all his work, and obtained a
glorious end. Thou oughtest to rejoice, he sayS, not to

If on parting from him whilst living he wept, so that Paul
sayS, Beiny mindful of th J tear-9, that I may be filled with2 Ti.m
joy, how much, more at his death? These things then he1'4

A 90οά fiylet, he says, therefore do thou engage in it. But is

nothing worthier than this contest. This crown is without
