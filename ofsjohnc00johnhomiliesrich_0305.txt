Α It is impossible! And the slave that is bought with money
complains if his master's commands are contrary to each
other. But shouldest thou grieve, when so many masters
give thee contrary orders, thou art condemned even for this,
and all mouths are opened against thee. Tell me then, is
this honour, is this rule, is this power?

One who holds the Episcopal office has required a contri· (4)
bution of money. He who is unwilling to contribute not
only withholds it, but that he may not seem to withhold it
from indifference, he accuses his Bishop. He is a thies, he
sayS, a robber, he engulphs the goods of the poor, he devours
the rights of the needy. Cease thy calumnies! How long
wilt thou say these things? Wilt thou not contribute ? No one
compels thee, there is no constraint. Why dost thou revile
him who counsels and advises thee? Is any one reduced to
need, and he from inability, or some otherhindrance, has notlent
a hand? No allowance is made for him, the reproaches in
this case are worse than in the other. This then is govem-
ment! And he cannot avenge himself. For they are his
own bowels, and as though the bowels be swollen‚ and
though they give pain to the head and the rest of the body,
we venture not on revenge‚ we cannot take a sword and
s pierce them3 so if one of those under our rule be of such
j sort, and create trouble and disorder by these accusationS,
we dare not avenge ourselveS, for this would be far from the
disposition of a father, but we must endure the grief till he
becomes sound and well.

The slave bought with money has an appointed work,
which when he has performed, he is afterwards his own mas—
ter. But the Bishop is distracted on every side, and is ex-
pected to do many things that are beyond his power. If he
knows not how to speak, there is great murmuring3 and if
he can speak, then he is accused of being vainglorious. If
he cannot raise the dead, he is of no worth, they say: such
an one is pious, but this man is not. If he eats a moderate
meal, for this he is accused, he ought to be sti-angled, they
say. If he is seen at the bath', he is much censured. ΙηιεΘΕ p.
short, he ought not to look upon the sun! If he does the 224.
