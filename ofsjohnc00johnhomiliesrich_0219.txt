wrongful dealings? How is this consistent? As she who
contributed two mites was considered equa] to the greatest
givers, because of her good intention, so thou, who stealest
two miteS, art as culpable as those mightier robbers. Nay‚
if I may give utterance to something strange, thou art a
worse robber than they. For a man would be equally an
adulterer, whether he committed the sin with the wife of a
king, or of a poor man, or of a slave: since the offence is
not judged by the quality of the personS, but by the wicked-
ness of his will who commits it; so is it likewise in this case.
Nay, I should call him who committed the sin with an
inferior perhaps more guilty, than him who intrigued with
the queen herself. For in this case, wealth‚ and beauty, and
other attractions might be pleaded, none of which existin the
other. Therefore the other is the worse adulterer. Again, he
seems to me a more determined drunkard, who commits that
excess with bad wine3 so he is a worse defrauder, who does
not despise small thefts 3 for he who commits great robberieS‚
would perhaps not stoop to petty thefts, whereas he who
steals little things would never forbear greater, therefore he
is the greater thief of the two. For how should he despise
gold, who does not despise silver? So that when we accuse
our rulers, let us recount our own faultS, and we shall find
ourselves more given to wrong and robbery than they: unless
we judge of right and wrong rather by the act, than by the
intention of the mind, as we ought to judge. If one should
be convicted of having stolen the goods of a poor man,
another those of a rich man, will they not both be punished
alike? Is not a man equally a murderer, whether he murder
a poor and deformed, or a rich and handsome, man? When
therefore we say that such an one has seized upon another
person's land, let us reflect upon our own faultS, and then
we shall not condemn other men, but we shall admire the
long-suffering of God. We shall not be indignant that
judgment does not fall upon them, but we shall be more
slow to commit wickedness ourselves. For when we perceive
ourselves liable to the same punishment, we shall no longer
