212 Misery of an meri-theous man's conscience.

2 Tm. righteousneSS, which is a most sweet thing, becomes bitter?

2‚18.19.It is the fault of our senses. Thus some have thought honey
bitter, and have taken with pleasure other things that were
noxious. And the cause is not in the nature of things, but
in the perverseness of the sufferers. The judging faculty of

‘euzae-the soul' is disordered¹. Just as a balance, if its bearn be
unsteady k, moves round, and does not shew accurately the
weight of things placed in it; so the soul, if it has not the
beam of its own thoughts fixed, and firmly riveted to the law
of God, being carried round and drawn down, will not be
able to judge aright of actions.

man, and you would see it pale and trembling, ashamed,
hiding its head, anxiously fearful, and self-condemned. For
should we sink down into the very depths of wickedneSS, the

‘ judging faculty of the mind¹ is not destroyed, but remains
unbribed. And no one pursues injustice thinking it to be
good, but he invents excuses, and has recourse to every arti-
fice of words to shift off the accusation. But he cannot get
it off his conscience. Here indeed the speciousness of words,
the corruption of rulers, and multitudes of flatterers, is often
able to throw justice into the shade,but within, the consciencem
has nothing of this sort, there are no flatterers there, no
