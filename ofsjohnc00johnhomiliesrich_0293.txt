honour is reflected upon the Masterh. As in our own affairs,

if the servant has great power, the master is the more admired,

for if the servant is so powerful, much more is he who com-
mands him. But if any man, neglecting his master's service
. thinks only of his wife, his son, or his servant,‘and seeks to

be rich, and to lay up treasure there, by stealing and robbing

his master of his possessionS, he is presently ruined, and his
wealth perishes with him.

WVherefore having these exampleS, Ι beseech yon, let us

not regard our possessions‚ that we may regard ourselves:
lnay, let us despise them, that we may obtain them. If we
despise thern, He will take care of them3 if we take care of
them, God will despise them. Let us labour in the concerns
” of God, not in our own, or rather really in our own, for His

are our own. Ι speak not of heaveni, nor of earth, nor of
λ the things of this world: these are unworthy of Him. And
they belong alike to the faithful and the unbelievers. What

then do I speak of as His? His glory and His kingdom. 2 Tim.

we suffr, we shall also reiqn with Him. We are become
joint laem, and are called His bret-‘lmen Why do we sink
below, when He is drawing us upward towards H imself ?
How long shall we be poor, and beggarly? Heaven is set
before us; and do we linger on earth? Is His kingdom
opened to us, and do we choose such poverty as is here? Is

life immortal offered US, and do we spend ourselves for landS,

sor wood and stones? Be truly rich. I would wish thee to

be so. Be covetous and rapacious, I blame thee not for it.
Here it is a fault not to be covetouS, here it is blameworthy

not to be grasping. What then is this? lee kinydom quatt
