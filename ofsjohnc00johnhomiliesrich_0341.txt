Some sins to be checked with authority. 315

   

⁵ ⁴ Zealous of qood works. Hom.
Dost thou see that our part is necessary, not merely works‚
²· ¹jbut zealou83 we should with all alacrity‚ with a becoming
¹ ’ ,ε3ῐῐιθεῑι1688, go forward in virtue. For when we were weighed
down with eviIS, and incurably diseased‚ it was of His loving-
· kindness that we were delivered. But what follows after this
³ is our part as well as His.

³: Ver. 15. These tkinys spealc and exhort, and rebulce with
’ all authority.

 

, These thinys speech, and exhort. Do you see how he
*charges Timothy? Reprove‚ rebuke, esclzort. But here,
Rebuke with all authority. For the manners of this people
..were more stubborn‚ wherefore he orders them to be re-
J’buked more roughly, and with all authority. For there
are some sins, which ought to be prevented by command.
We may with persuasion advise men to despise richeS, to
*be meek‚ and the like. But the adulterer, the fornicator,
⁸ the desrauder, ought to be brought to a better course by
ι command. And those who are addicted to augury and
2³ divination, and the like, should be corrected with all au-
- thority. Observe how he would have him insist on these
things with independence‚ and with entire freedom ¹. Ιίξονσίπ
Let no man despice thee. But
Chap. iii. 1. Put them in mind to be suby'ect to principa-
lities and power-5, to obey mayistratffl, to be ready to every
qood work, to spe-ak evil os no man, to be no brawlera
What then? even when meu do evil, may we not revile
them? nay, but to be ready to every qood work, to spealc evil
qs no man. Hear the exhortation, To spealc evil of no man.
Our lips should be pure from reviling. For if our reproaches
are true, it is not for us to utter them, but for the J udge to
inquire into the matter. For why, he sayS, dost thou judye {wib
thy brother? But if they are not true, how great the fire‘. ² ⁴
Hear what the thief says to his fellow thief. For we are also {gukfo
in the same condemnation. We are running the same ' ‘
, hazard2’. If thou revilest others, thou wilt soon fall into the'2 0²73·oe

same sins, Therefore the blessed Paul admonishes us: Letl Cor.
him that standetk, take keed lest kefall. ¹⁰² ¹²·
