246 Divinatione of devils condemned and defied.

saying, Thou art confident that thou thyseff art a quide of
the blind, a liyht of them which are in darkness, an in-
slractor of the foolisloe, a teacher of babes: Thou seest that
the Law is the light of them which are in darkness3 and if
that which sheweth the letter, the letter which killeth, is light,
what then is the Spirit which quickeneth? If the Old
Covenant is light, what is the NeW, which contains so
many, and so great revelations? where the difference is as
great, as if any one should open heaven to those who only
know the earth, and make all things there visible. There
we learn concerning hell, heaven, and judgment. Let us
not believe in things irrational. They are nothing but im·-
posture. ‘ What,’ you say, ‘ when what they foretell comes
to pass?’ It is because you believe it, if it does come to
paSS. The impostor 1138 taken thee captive. Thy life is in
his power, he manages thee as he will. If a captain of
robbers should have under his power and disposal the son of
a king, who had fied to him, preferring the desert, and his
lawless company, would he be able to pronounce whether he
would live or die? Assuredly he would, not because he
knows the future, but because he is the disposer of his life or
death, the youth having put himself in his power. For
according to his own pleasure, he may either kill him, or
spare his life, as he is become subject to him, and it is equally ³

li Ε· at his1 disposal to say whether thou shalt be rich or poor.

The greater part of the world have delivered themselves up
into the hands of the devil.

And furthermore, it contributes much to favour the
pretences of these deceiverS‚ that a man has accustOmed
himself to believe in them. For no one takes notice of their
failureS, but their lucky conjectures are observed. But if
these men have any power of prognosticating, bring them to
me, a believer. I say not this, as magnifying myself, (for it
is no great honour to be superior to these things,) and indeed
I am deep-laden with sins3 but with respect to these matterS,
I will not be humble-minded3 by the grace of Grod I despise
them all. Bring me this pretender to magic3 let him, if he

has any power of prognosticating, tell me what will happen

to me to-morrow. But he will not tell me. For 1 3111 under
