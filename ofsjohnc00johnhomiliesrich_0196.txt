it is kept alive. For it is in thee indeed, but do thou render
it more vehement, that is, fill it with confidence, with joy and
delight. Stand mansully.

Ver. 7. For God laath, not qiven us the spirit os sear, but
of power, and of love, and of α sound mind.

That is, we did not receive the spirit, that we should
shrink from exertion, but that we may speak with boldness.

contrary, a spirit of power, and of love toward Himsels.
This, then, is of grace, and yet not merely of grace, but when

another on account of his child, or his domestic, another of
his friend, another of his enemy, another of his neighbour,
another from some loss, And various are the causes of sor-

For there is no such thing in this mortal life as being ex-
