Present honour of Saints a siqu of tlee future. 205

*finite blessingS. But the unbeliever will not be convinced. Hom.
Let him believe then from the present. The tent-maker
³ is more illustrious, more honoured than the king. No em-
peror of Rome ever enjoyed so great honour. The emperor
is cast out, and lies, no one knows where. The tent-maker
occupies the midst of the city, as if he were a king, and
living. From these things believe, even with respect to the
³ future. If he enjoys so great honour here, where he was per-
secuted and banished, what will he not be when he shall

 

come hereafter? If when he was a tent-maliet, he was so
illustrious, what will he be when he shall come rivalling the
beams of the sun? Isin so much meanness he overcame such
magnificence, to whom, at his coming, will he not be superior?
Can we avoid the conclusion? Who is not moved by the
fact, that a tent-maker became more honourable than the
ἵ most honoured of kin gs Ρ If here things happened so beyond
the course of nature, much more will it be so hereafter. If
thou wilt not believe the future, Ο man, believe the present.
If thou wilt not believe invisible things, believe things that
are seen: or rather believe things which are seen, for so thou
wilt believe things which are invisible. But if thou wilt not,
we may fitly say with the Apostle, We are pure from your2 A60ts 20,
blood: for we have testified to you of all things, and have left26
out nothing that we should have said. Blame yourselves
therefore, and to yourselvesh will ye impute the punishment
of Hell. But let US, my beloved children, be imitators of
Paul, not in his saith only, but in his life, that we may attain
to heavenly glory, and tramplebupon that glory that is here.
Let not any things present attract us‚ Let us despise visible
thingS, that we may obtain heavenly things, or rather mayi
through these obtain the others, but let it be our aim pre-
eminently to obtain those, of which God grant that we may be
all accounted worthy, through the grace and lovingkind-
