J What then? He had no enjoyment from all these things.

Ἴ 80081 splendid hou'ses, does the sight of them delude thee?
Look up to heaven. Raise thy view from pillars of stone to
that beautiful fabric, compared with which the others are as
the works of ants and pismires. Learn philosophy from
that spectacle, ascend to heavenly things, and look thence
upon our 'splendid buildings, and see that they are nothing,
the mere toys of little children. Seest thou not how much
finer, how much lighter‚ how much purer, how much more
translucent, is the air the higher thou ascendest? There have
they that do alms their mansions and their tabernacles. These
that are here are dissolved at the resurrection, or rather before
the resurrection destroyed by the stroke of time. Nay, often in
their most flourishing state and period an earthquake over-
throws‚ or fire entirely ruins them. For not only the bodies of
men, but their very buildings are 1101110 10 untimely deathS.
