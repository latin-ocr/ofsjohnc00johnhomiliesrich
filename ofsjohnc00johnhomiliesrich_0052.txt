26 Mercy implies iel desert ,· Grace is more than Ivlercy.

For this cause, he sayS, that he obtained mercy. What then
does he mean when he says, He coanted me faithful? He
would give up no right of his Master’s: even his own part he
ascribed to Him, and assumed nothing to himself, nor claimed
for his own the glory which was due to God. Hence in
Acts 14, another place we find him exclaiming, Sirs, why do με these
15. tlcinqs to us ? we also are men of like passion-5 with you. So

since mercy is for such. And again in another place he

This is added, lest hearing that he obtained mercy, we
should understand by it only, that being deserving of punish-
ment, as a persecutor and blasphemer, nevertheless he was
not punished. But mercy was not confined to this, that
punishment was not inflicted3 many other great favours
are implied by it. For not only has God released us from
the impending punishment, but He has made us riyh teous too,
and song, and brethren, and heim, and joint-heim. Therefore
it is he sayS, that yrace was exceedinq abundant. . For the
gists bestowed were beyond mercy, since they are not such
as would come of mercy only, but of affection and excessive
love. Having thus enlarged upon the love of God which,
not content with shewing mercyto a blasphemer and perse-
cutor, conferred upon him other blessings in abundance, he
has guarded against that error of the unbelievers which takes
away free will, by adding, with saith and love which is in
Christ Jesus. Thus much only, he sayS, did we contribute.
We have believed that He is able to save us.
