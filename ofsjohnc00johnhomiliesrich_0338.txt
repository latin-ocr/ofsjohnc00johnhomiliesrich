312 Gracc to* deny worldly lusis yiven with pardon-

Trrus bestow high favours upon him, who do you think would not
2,11-14. be overcome at hearing of such kindness? But do not think

 

that grace stops at the pardon of former sins—it secures us
against them in future, for this also is of grace. Since if He
were never to punish those who still do amiss, this would not 1
be so much grace, as encouragement to evil and wickedneSS.

For tlze yraee of God, he sayS, laath appeared, teaclzinq
us that, denyiny unqodliness and worldly lus-158, we should
live soberly, riykteously, and θοάζω] in the present world,-
loolcinysor the bles-sed hope, and tlte ylorious appeariny of
tlze yreat God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. See, how to-
gether with the rewards he places the virtue. And this is of
grace, to deliver us srom worldly things, and to lead us to
Heaven. He speaks here of two appearings; for there are
two; the first of grace, the second of retribution and justice.

T hat denyiny ecnyodliwess, he says, and worldly lust-3.

See here the foundation of all virtue. He has not said
‘ avoiding,' but εἰρημένῳ. Denying implies the greatest dis-

,ρ tance, the greatest hatred and aversion. With as much reso-
lution and zea] as they turned from idols, with so much let
them turn from vice itself, and worldly lusts. For these too
are idols, that is, worldly lustS, and covetousness, and this
he names idolatry. Whatever things are useful for the pre-
sent life are worldly lustsb, whatever things perish with
the present life are worldly lusts, Let us then have nothing
to do with these. Christ came, ‘ that we should deny un-

’ἀσίβειαν godliness ¹.’ Ungodliness relates to doctrineS, worldly lusts to
a wicked life.
And should live soberly, riyhteously, and yodly in the pre-
sent world.

(2) Dost thou see, what I always affirm, that it is not sobriety
only to abstain from fornication, but that we must be free
from other passions. So then he who loves wealth is not
sober. For as the fornicator loves women, so the other loves
money, and even more inordinately, for he is not impelled by

Ξάκρωτὺς so strong a passion. And he is certainly a more powerless²
charioteer who cannot manage a gentle horse, than he who
cannot restrain a wild and unruly one. What then? says he,

ᾗ 2 Mss. add, whatever things go not with us to heaven are worldly lusts.
