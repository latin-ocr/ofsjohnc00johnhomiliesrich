‘204 Honour of St. Paul in the Resurrection.

2 TIM· The tomb of the one is no where to be seen ; but the other'
2⁹ ω’ lies in the royal city itse]f‚ in greater splendour than any
king, even there where he conquered‚ where he raised his
trophy. If mention is made of the one, it is with reproach,
even among his kindred, for he is said to have been pro-
fligate. But the memory of the other is every where accom-
panied with a good report, not amongh us only, but among
his enemies. For when truth shines forth, it puts to shame
even one's enemies, and if they admire him not for his saith,

than the living. When that our life shall come, what will he
not participate ? What will he not attain?

On this account God made him enjoy these honours,
not because he wanted them. For if when in the body
he despised popular glory, much more will he despise
it now that he is delivered from the body. Nor only on
this account has He caused him to enjoy honour, but that
those who disbelieve the future may be convineed from
the present. I say that when the Resurrection shall be,
Paul will come with the King of Heaven, and will enjoy in-
