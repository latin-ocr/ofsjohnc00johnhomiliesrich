 

God's qoodness questioned if⁸He puni-she& 36¹1

lately discoursed with you about Hell, and I deserred my Hom.
argument upon the lovingkindness of God. It· is proper 111.
therefore to—day to resume it. That there will, then, be a hell,
we have, as I think, sufficiently proved, bringing forward the
deluge, and former eviIS, and arguing that it is not possible
that He who performedlthese things should leave the men of
the present age unpunished. For if thus He chastised those
who sinned before the LaW, He will not let those go unpu-
nished who after grace have committed greater wickedness.
It has been questioned therefore how is He good? how mer·-
ciful to man, if at least He punishes? and we have defen-ed

the argument, that we might not overwhelm your ears with a
multitude of words.

 

Come, to-day let us discharge the debt, and shew how
good is God, even in punishing. For this discourse would
be suitable for us in opposition to the heretics. Let us γ
therefore pay earnest heed to it. God, standing in no need
of any thing from us, yet created us. For that He stood in
no need of us, is manifest from His having made us after a
long* time. For He might have made us long ago, if He had
3 needed us. For if He Himself waS, even without ηε, and we
were made in later timeS, He made uS, not needing uS.

He made the Heaven, the earth, the sea, all things that
exist, for our sake. Tell me, are not these marks of good-
ness? And many things one might mention. But to cut
short the matter, He malcetle, the svm to rise on the evil and Matt.5,
on the qood, aud sendech rain on the just and on the unjzcst. 45.
Is not this a mark of goodness? No, you say. For I said once
in conversing with a Marcionite, Are not these things a
mark of *goodness? and he answered, If He did not call
men to account for their sins, it were a mark of goodness.
But if He calls them to account, it is not goodness.
That man, however, is not now present. But come, let u's
repeat what was then said, and more beside. For I, out of
my superfluity, shew that if He did not call men to account,
He wo‘uld not be good; but because He does call them to
account, therefore He is good.

For, say, if He did not call us to account, would human
life then have endured? Should we not then have fallen
vinto the state of beasts? For if when there is this sear im-
