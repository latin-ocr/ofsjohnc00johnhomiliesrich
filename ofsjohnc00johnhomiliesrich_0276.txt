2 TIM· For I am now ready to be offered up, he says. For this

2225ss reason he writes: Alc Scripture is yiven by inspiration of

4, 6. ’ God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof3 for cor-

all that sacred writing, he meanS, of which Ι was speaking.
This is said of what he was discoursing of 3 about which he

All such, then, is ,qiven by inspiration os God ; therefore, he
