God, he sayS‚ I have a true conscience for my part, and thou
hast thy tertre, and not thy tears only, but for thyfaitlz, be-

deceit in thee. As therefore thou shewest thyself worthy of
love, being so affectionate, so genuine a disciple of Christ 3
and as I am not one of those who are devoid of affection, but

thee by tlze puttiny on of my hands& that is, the grace of the
spirit, which thou hast received, for presiding over the Church‚
